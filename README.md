CSIS 4260 â€“ Assignment 2: Web Scraping and Text Analysis

Project Summary

This project is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Web Scraping

Task: Research and compare two popular web scraping libraries (such as Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, MechanicalSoup, Playwright, or others).

Deliverable: Recommend a library based on benchmarks, ease of use, and performance.

Implementation: Use the selected library to scrape at least 100 articles/pages from a public site (e.g., BBC News, a subreddit) on a chosen topic.

Part 2: Text Analysis

Task: Apply at least two text analysis algorithms (such as TF-IDF, sentiment analysis, emotion mining, LLM APIs like GPT, Llama, etc.) to the collected data.

Deliverable: Provide a summary of each scraped page and assign an importance score with a direction (positive or negative).

Output: Present the results in a tabulated form along with the code implementation.

Key Project Components:

Web Scraping: Data collection from the web using Python libraries.

Text Analysis: Data processing, cleaning, and application of NLP algorithms.

Technologies Used: Python, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, TextBlob, TF-IDF, CountVectorizer.

Final Output: CSV file containing articles, summaries, and importance scores with direction, along with visualizations like word clouds and sentiment graphs.
