PM 'ready' to put troops on ground in Ukraine to protect peace,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gxgxl3grgo,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he is ""ready and willing"" to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the UK prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was ""essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future"". Before attending an emergency summit with European leaders in Paris on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by ""putting our own troops on the ground if necessary"". ""I do not say that lightly,"" he wrote. ""I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."" The prime minister added: ""But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country."" The end of Russia's war with Ukraine ""when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again"", Sir Keir said. UK troops could be deployed alongside soldiers from other European nations alongside the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory. Sir Keir's announcement comes after the former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, told the BBC the UK military was ""so run down"" it could not lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. The PM has previously only hinted that British troops could be involved in safeguarding Ukraine after a ceasefire. He is due to visit President Donald Trump in Washington later this month and said a ""US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again"". Sir Keir is meeting with other European leaders in response to concerns the US is moving forward with Russia on peace talks that will lock out the continent. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days, US officials say. On Saturday the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said European leaders would be consulted only and not take part in any talks between the US and Russia. A senior Ukrainian government source told the BBC on Sunday that Kyiv has not been invited to talks between the US and Russia. Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the ""ridiculous war"" in Ukraine would begin ""immediately"". Trump then ""informed"" Zelensky of his plan. On Sunday, Trump said that he expected Zelensky to be involved in the talks. He also said he would allow European nations to buy US weapons for Ukraine. Asked by the BBC about his timetable for an end to fighting, Trump said only that ""we're working to get it done"" and laid the blame for the war on the previous administration's Ukraine policies. Writing in the Telegraph, Sir Keir said ""peace cannot come at any cost"" and ""Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations, because anything less would accept Putin's position that Ukraine is not a real nation"". He added: ""We cannot have another situation like Afghanistan, where the US negotiated directly with the Taliban and cut out the Afghan government - in reference to a deal negotiated by Trump's first administration, which was later enacted by the Biden administration. ""I feel sure that President Trump will want to avoid this too,"" said Sir Keir Sir Keir said Ukraine's path to Nato membership was ""irreversible"" and European nations ""must increase our defence spending and take on a greater role"" in the alliance. The UK currently spends around 2.3% of GDP on defence and has committed to increase defence spending to a 2.5% share of the economy, without giving a timeframe for this. Trump has called for Nato members to spend 5% of GDP on defence, while Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has suggested allies should spend more than 3%. Lord Dannatt - who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2009 - told the BBC up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed on rotation for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine and ""we just haven't got that number available"". He said, in total, a force to keep the peace would require about 100,000 troops on the ground and the UK would have to supply ""quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it"". The meeting in Paris called by French President Emmanuel Macron will see Sir Keir joined by leaders from Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark along with the presidents of the European Council and European Commission, and Rutte. Sir Keir Starmer says the figure is a ""shot in the arm"", but ""the job isn't done"" to bring down waiting lists. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says the UK could act as a ""bridge"" between the US and Europe. Sir John says US policy will embolden Russia and China, with gains since the fall of the Soviet Union being reversed. It comes as Donald Trump's envoy says Europe will not be involved in peace talks to end the war.

"Ukraine not invited to US-Russia peace talks, source tells BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm292319gr2o,"Kyiv has not been invited to talks between the US and Russia aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian government source has told the BBC. The US special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg had said Kyiv would be involved in Monday's talks in Saudi Arabia, but the source said no delegation would be present. European leaders have also not been asked to join the discussions, and are due to meet instead on Monday in Paris at a summit hastily arranged by the French president, as fears grow the continent is being locked out of negotiations. The separate meetings follow a turbulent week where Washington has signalled a drastic change in its approach to the war in Ukraine. The White House's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed he was travelling to Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening for the first face-to-face talks between the US and Russia towards ending the conflict. US President Donald Trump revealed on Sunday that Witkoff had met with Putin already ""for a very extended period, like about three hours"". Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer and friend of Trump, was in Moscow this week to secure the release of a US teacher imprisoned on charges of marijuana possession. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz are also set to meet Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia, less than a week after Trump held a phone call with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin.  The call on Wednesday brought to an end a three-year freeze on direct contact between Moscow and Washington.  Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out accepting a peace deal negotiated without Ukraine, telling US television network NBC on Sunday that he would ""never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine, never"". Witkoff said US officials were speaking separately with Ukrainian officials and that it was ""part of the talks"" - but did not indicate whether he expected Kyiv to be present in Saudi Arabia. Trump told reporters in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday he expected Zelensky to be involved in the talks. He also said he would allow European nations to buy US weapons for Ukraine. Asked by the BBC when he believed any peace negotiations could bear fruit and end the fighting, Trump said only that ""we're working to get it done"" and laid the blame for the war on the previous administration's Ukraine policies. Meanwhile, Rubio downplayed the Saudi Arabia talks, saying one meeting would not solve the war and that a formal negotiating process - that would mediate between Ukraine, Russia and third parties - had not yet been set up. He told CBS News, however, that the next few days would determine if Putin was serious about achieving peace. It is against this backdrop that a group of European leaders - including the UK's Keir Starmer, Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte, Germany's chancellor Olaf Scholz and the European Commission's Ursula von der Leyen - will meet in Paris. French President Emmanuel Macron will hold an informal meeting in the afternoon on Ukraine and European security. Ahead of the summit, Sir Keir said the UK was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by ""putting our own troops on the ground if necessary"". Writing in the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper, the prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine ""is essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future"". US Ukraine envoy Kellog had earlier dismissed concerns over Europe not being invited to Saudi Arabia, arguing previous negotiations had failed due to the involvement of too many parties. ""It may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest,"" he said on Saturday. The meetings mark an acceleration in Trump's efforts to achieve a swift end to the war. The White House said the US president had held a ""lengthy"" phone-call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, after which Trump said negotiations to stop the ""ridiculous war"" in Ukraine would begin immediately. He also said it was not ""practical"" for Ukraine to join Nato and ""unlikely"" it could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders. Ukraine has repeatedly called for Nato membership and has rejected ceding territory as part of any peace deal. Trump's stance has also been echoed by his defence secretary, fuelling European alarm that the US may be making concessions to Russia before any peace deal was negotiated. Pete Hegseth also said European nations must provide the ""overwhelming"" share of funding for Ukraine - claiming the US would no longer ""tolerate an imbalanced relationship"" with its allies.  US Vice-President JD Vance likewise told the Munich Security Conference on Friday that Europe must ""step up in a big way to provide for its own defence"", in his speech largely spent criticising European democracies. Zelensky called on Saturday for the creation of a European army, arguing the continent could no longer count on Washington. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine continued on Sunday - with Zelensky saying a Russian attack had left at least 100,000 people without power in Mykolaiv. He said homes were without heating following a drone strike on the city's ""critical infrastructure"". Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, having already seized Crimea and part of the eastern Donbas region in 2014. US-Israeli talks follow President Trump's proposal - widely condemned internationally - to take over Gaza and move the Palestinians out.

Second DR Congo city falls to Rwanda-backed rebels,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rqr8q5v52o,"Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have entered Bukavu, the second-largest city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the regional governor's office. Some people lined the streets to clap and cheer the fighters as they marched and drove into the city centre without resistance. It is the second city after Goma to fall to the rebels in the mineral-rich region in the past few weeks. The Congolese government has acknowledged its fall and urged residents to stay at home ""to avoid being targeted by the occupying forces"". The UN and European countries have warned that the latest offensive, which has seen hundreds of thousands of people forced from their homes, could spark a wider regional war. A resident in Bukavu, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns for her safety, told the BBC on Sunday that most people were still afraid to leave their homes. ""Since yesterday the children and the youth took the weapons. They are shooting everywhere in all directions, they are looting,"" she said. ""This morning the M23 entered and they were acclaimed by the people, very happy to see them. We don't know if it's because they are afraid or because they found that there were no authorities in the city. ""The place where I live the crackling [gunfire] can still be heard."" On Friday, the M23 captured Bukavu's main airport, which is about 30km (18 miles) north of the city - and then began advancing slowly towards the city, which is the capital of South-Kivu province. The provincial governor, Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki, confirmed to the Reuters news agency the fighters were in Bukavu city centre by Sunday morning, adding that Congolese troops had withdrawn to avoid urban fighting. This left a security vacuum in the city on Saturday with chaotic scenes playing out, including a reported prison break from the central prison. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said a warehouse with nearly 7,000 tonnes of food was looted. The city of around two million people on the southern tip of Lake Kivu borders Rwanda and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade. Its fall represents an unprecedented expansion of territory for the M23 since their latest insurgency started in late 2021 - and is a blow to the government of President Félix Tshisekedi. Government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said Rwanda was violating DR Congo's territorial integrity through expansionist ambitions and human rights abuses. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region - as well as having troops on the ground - so it can benefit from its natural resources, something Kigali denies. President Tshisekedi wants his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame to face sanctions over the latest unrest. But President Kagame has dismissed such threats - and has repeatedly pointed out that Rwanda's main priority is its security. He has long been angered by what he sees as the failure of the Congolese authorities to deal with the DR Congo-based FLDR rebel group, which he sees as a danger to Rwanda. The group is made up of some members of the ethnic Hutu militia accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda when over 100 days around 800,000 people, mainly from the Tutsi ethnic group, were killed. Troops from the Tusti-led M23 gathered at the Place de l'Indépendance in central Bukavu on Sunday, where one of its commanders, Bernard Byamungu, was filmed chatting to locals and answering their questions in Swahili. He urged government forces ""hiding in houses"" to surrender - and accused the withdrawing military of spreading terror by arming local youths who had gone on a looting rampage. The African Union (AU) - which has been holding a heads of state summit in Ethiopia this weekend - again urged the M23 to disarm. ""We are all very, very concerned about an open regional war,"" Reuters quotes the AU's peace and security commissioner Bankole Adeo as saying.

"Ukraine not invited to US-Russia peace talks, source tells BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm292319gr2o,"Kyiv has not been invited to talks between the US and Russia aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian government source has told the BBC. The US special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg had said Kyiv would be involved in Monday's talks in Saudi Arabia, but the source said no delegation would be present. European leaders have also not been asked to join the discussions, and are due to meet instead on Monday in Paris at a summit hastily arranged by the French president, as fears grow the continent is being locked out of negotiations. The separate meetings follow a turbulent week where Washington has signalled a drastic change in its approach to the war in Ukraine. The White House's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed he was travelling to Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening for the first face-to-face talks between the US and Russia towards ending the conflict. US President Donald Trump revealed on Sunday that Witkoff had met with Putin already ""for a very extended period, like about three hours"". Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer and friend of Trump, was in Moscow this week to secure the release of a US teacher imprisoned on charges of marijuana possession. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz are also set to meet Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia, less than a week after Trump held a phone call with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin.  The call on Wednesday brought to an end a three-year freeze on direct contact between Moscow and Washington.  Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out accepting a peace deal negotiated without Ukraine, telling US television network NBC on Sunday that he would ""never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine, never"". Witkoff said US officials were speaking separately with Ukrainian officials and that it was ""part of the talks"" - but did not indicate whether he expected Kyiv to be present in Saudi Arabia. Trump told reporters in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday he expected Zelensky to be involved in the talks. He also said he would allow European nations to buy US weapons for Ukraine. Asked by the BBC when he believed any peace negotiations could bear fruit and end the fighting, Trump said only that ""we're working to get it done"" and laid the blame for the war on the previous administration's Ukraine policies. Meanwhile, Rubio downplayed the Saudi Arabia talks, saying one meeting would not solve the war and that a formal negotiating process - that would mediate between Ukraine, Russia and third parties - had not yet been set up. He told CBS News, however, that the next few days would determine if Putin was serious about achieving peace. It is against this backdrop that a group of European leaders - including the UK's Keir Starmer, Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte, Germany's chancellor Olaf Scholz and the European Commission's Ursula von der Leyen - will meet in Paris. French President Emmanuel Macron will hold an informal meeting in the afternoon on Ukraine and European security. Ahead of the summit, Sir Keir said the UK was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by ""putting our own troops on the ground if necessary"". Writing in the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper, the prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine ""is essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future"". US Ukraine envoy Kellog had earlier dismissed concerns over Europe not being invited to Saudi Arabia, arguing previous negotiations had failed due to the involvement of too many parties. ""It may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest,"" he said on Saturday. The meetings mark an acceleration in Trump's efforts to achieve a swift end to the war. The White House said the US president had held a ""lengthy"" phone-call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, after which Trump said negotiations to stop the ""ridiculous war"" in Ukraine would begin immediately. He also said it was not ""practical"" for Ukraine to join Nato and ""unlikely"" it could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders. Ukraine has repeatedly called for Nato membership and has rejected ceding territory as part of any peace deal. Trump's stance has also been echoed by his defence secretary, fuelling European alarm that the US may be making concessions to Russia before any peace deal was negotiated. Pete Hegseth also said European nations must provide the ""overwhelming"" share of funding for Ukraine - claiming the US would no longer ""tolerate an imbalanced relationship"" with its allies.  US Vice-President JD Vance likewise told the Munich Security Conference on Friday that Europe must ""step up in a big way to provide for its own defence"", in his speech largely spent criticising European democracies. Zelensky called on Saturday for the creation of a European army, arguing the continent could no longer count on Washington. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine continued on Sunday - with Zelensky saying a Russian attack had left at least 100,000 people without power in Mykolaiv. He said homes were without heating following a drone strike on the city's ""critical infrastructure"". Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, having already seized Crimea and part of the eastern Donbas region in 2014. US-Israeli talks follow President Trump's proposal - widely condemned internationally - to take over Gaza and move the Palestinians out. Kentucky has seen the worst effects of the rain thus far, reporting at least eight dead. The president opened the Nascar season with a flyby and lap in front of the racing cars. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says the UK could act as a ""bridge"" between the US and Europe.

Netanyahu praises Trump's 'bold vision' for Gaza at Rubio meeting,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9eddnnq4go,"Israel's prime minister has said he is working to make US President Donald Trump's plan to remove and resettle Gaza's population ""a reality"". Benjamin Netanyahu said he was co-operating with the US on a ""common strategy"" for the Palestinian territory after a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem on Sunday. The talks come after US President Donald Trump proposed a US takeover Gaza and removal of the two million Palestinians there to neighbouring countries.  The UN has warned that any forced displacement of civilians from occupied territory is strictly prohibited under international law and ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"". America's top diplomat said President Trump's plan may have ""shocked and surprised"" people, but it took ""courage"" to propose an alternative to ""tired ideas"" of the past. Netanyahu said he and Rubio had discussed ways to implement Trump's vision, adding that the US and Israel had a common position on Gaza. The Israeli leader warned that the ""gates of hell"" would be opened if all Israeli hostages held by the armed group Hamas were not released. ""Hamas can not continue as a military or government force,"" Rubio added. ""And as long as it stands as a force that can govern or administer or a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible."" The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. The fighting has caused devastation in Gaza, where more than 48,200 people have been killed during the 16-month war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter. Palestinian and Arab leaders have widely rejected Trump's Gaza takeover plan, with the Palestinian Authority and Hamas emphasising that Palestinian land is ""not for sale"". Unlike previous US peace efforts in the region, the US top diplomat did not meet any Palestinian leaders to discuss the future of Gaza. Speaking at a joint news conference on Sunday, Rubio and Netanyahu outlined areas of agreement, including a desire to eradicate Hamas's governing capacity in the enclave, prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon, and to monitor developments in post-Assad Syria. Rubio went on to accuse Tehran of being ""behind every act of violence, behind every destabilising activity, behind everything that threatens peace and stability"" in the region. Netanyahu also condemned what he called ""lawfare"" from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which he said ""outrageously libelled"" Israel. He thanked the US administration for issuing sanctions against the ICC, which last year issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former defence minister over alleged war crimes in Gaza - which Israel denies - as well as a top Hamas commander. Rubio is visiting Israel on his first tour of the Middle East as the US secretary of state. He is also due to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in coming days for talks on the war in Ukraine - a meeting that neither Ukraine nor other European countries have been invited to. His visit comes after a shipment of American-made heavy bombs arrived in Israel overnight. Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said his country had received a delivery of MK-84 bombs from the US late on Saturday, after Trump overturned a block on exporting the munitions placed by his predecessor, Joe Biden. Biden initially shipped thousands of MK-84s to Israel after Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, but later declined to clear the bombs for export out of concern for their impact on Gaza. The powerful 2,000-pound bombs have a wide blast radius and can rip through concrete and metal, destroying entire buildings. Katz said the shipment represented a ""significant asset"" for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and served as evidence of the ""strong alliance between Israel and the United States"". Meanwhile, Hamas said an Israeli air strike had killed three police officers near Rafah in southern Gaza on Sunday, which it called a ""serious violation"" of the ceasefire. Israel said it had struck ""several armed individuals"" in southern Gaza. The ceasefire came into force on 19 January and requires a complete pause in fighting for the first 42-day phase.  Fears had been high this week that the fragile ceasefire agreement could collapse after a dispute over a planned hostage release, which was nearly aborted but ultimately went ahead on Saturday. Netanyahu's office confirmed on Sunday that an Israeli negotiating team would travel to Cairo on Monday to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire. The Munich conference exposed tensions between the US and Europe over Nato and Ukraine - the BBC's Frank Gardner explains why this was a watershed in relations. A Ukrainian government source told the BBC Kyiv would not be present at the proposed peace talks. Kentucky has seen the worst effects of the rain thus far, reporting at least eight dead.

World's 'first openly gay imam' shot dead in South Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05l33j7rq7o,"Muhsin Hendricks, a pioneering figure dubbed the world's first openly gay imam, has been shot dead in South Africa. The 57-year-old cleric ran a mosque in Cape Town intended as a safe haven for gay and other marginalised Muslims. He was killed on Saturday morning after the car in which he was travelling near the southern city of Gqeberha was ambushed. ""Two unknown suspects with covered faces got out of the vehicle and started firing multiple shots at the vehicle,"" police said in a statement. News of Hendricks' death has sent shockwaves through the LGBTQ+ community and beyond, prompting an outpouring of tributes from across the globe. Julia Ehrt, executive director at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (Ilga), called on the authorities to thoroughly investigate ""what we fear may be a hate crime"". ""He supported and mentored so many people in South Africa and around the world in their journey to reconcile with their faith, and his life has been a testament to the healing that solidarity across communities can bring in everyone's lives,"" she said.   Hendricks was killed after he had reportedly officiated at a lesbian wedding, though this has not been officially confirmed. The details of the attack emerged through security footage that was shared on social media. It shows a car pulling up and blocking the vehicle in which Hendricks was travelling as it was pulling away from the curb. According to police, the imam was in the back seat. The angle of CCTV footage reveals what happened from one side of the road - an assailant jumps out of a car, runs to the ambushed vehicle and shoots repeatedly through the back passenger window. Hendricks' Al-Ghurbaah Foundation, which runs the Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque in the Wynberg suburb of Cape Town, confirmed he had died in a targeted attack on Saturday morning. But Abdulmugheeth Petersen, chair of the foundation's board, appealed via a WhatsApp group for their followers to be patient, stressing the importance of protecting Hendricks' family. Hendricks' work challenged traditional interpretations of Islam and championed a compassionate, inclusive faith. South Africa's post-apartheid constitution was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation and in 2006, became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage. But despite a thriving LGBT community, gay people still face discrimination and violence. The country also has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Hendricks came out as gay in 1996, which shocked the wider Muslim community in Cape Town and elsewhere. That same year, he founded The Inner Circle, an organisation providing support and a safe space for queer Muslims seeking to reconcile their faith and sexuality before going on to establish the inclusive Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque. He was the subject of a documentary in 2022 called The Radical, in which he said about the threats he faced: ""The need to be authentic was greater than the fear to die."" Hendricks often spoke about the importance of interfaith dialogue and the need to address the mental health issues and trauma faced by LGBTQ+ individuals within religious communities. He told the Ilga World Conference in Cape Town last year: ""It is important that we stop to look at religion as the enemy."" Reverend Jide Macaulay, an openly gay Anglican minister, described Hendricks' death as ""truly heartbreaking"". The British-Nigerian LGBTQ rights activist runs House of Rainbow, an organisation that provides support for gay people in Nigeria where same-sex relationships or public displays of affection are illegal, and paid tribute to Hendricks' bravery. ""Your leadership, courage, and unwavering dedication to inclusive faith communities have left an indelible mark,"" he said. Sadiq Lawal, a gay Muslim man living in Nigeria, told the BBC that Hendricks, had made such an impact as he had made ""the impossible possible"" by saying the words: ""I'm a queer imam."" ""He's a mentor to many queer Muslims in Africa, especially in Nigeria, because of religious extremism,"" he said. ""I'm still in shock and devastated.""

Conclave and The Brutalist win big at the Baftas ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge2gdle6ko,"Pope drama Conclave and immigration epic The Brutalist walked away with some of the biggest prizes at the Bafta film awards on Sunday. Conclave, made by German director Edward Berger, picked up four awards in total including best film and best British film; the first time a movie has won both in the same year since the 2019 war drama, 1917. It also won best adapted screenplay and best editing. US filmmaker Brady Corbet's The Brutalist also won four - Corbet picked up best director while Adrien Brody won best actor for his portrayal of Hungarian architect and Holocaust survivor,  László Tóth. The film also won best original score and cinematography. Other winners included Mikey Madison (best actress, for Anora), Kieran Culkin (best supporting actor, for A Real Pain) and Zoe Saldaña (best supporting actress, for Emilia Pérez).  Anora, about a New York stripper who has a whirlwind romance with the son of a Russian oligarch, had been picking up best picture momentum ahead of the Oscars next month - but instead came away with best actress and best casting. The best actress win for Madison was something of a surprise, despite her impressive performance in Sean Baker's film. Madison herself, on accepting the prize, said: ""Wow, I really wasn't expecting this. I probably should have listened to my publicist  and written a speech or something!"" The 25-year-old starred in US comedy series Better Things and also had roles in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and horror film Scream. But her leading role in Anora has catapulted her into the spotlight. Madison added: ""I want to take a moment to recognise the sex worker community. I see you, you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be an ally and a friend."" Demi Moore, who stars in body horror The Substance, has been picking up best actress prizes in the last couple of months, including at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards. Many thought she would win the Bafta, too. She will still be a favourite at the Oscars although Madison's Bafta win does make things more interesting. The Substance only picked up one win on Sunday for make-up and hair. The film sees a TV aerobics presenter in her 50s (Moore) who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself. Full of gory effects, the film is the favourite to pick up the same prize at next month's Oscars.   Conclave, about a a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals who gather in Rome to elect a new Pope, which stars Ralph Fiennes, had led the charge with 12 nominations. Berger said he was ""deeply moved"" to win best film, and that winning outstanding British film, was ""a huge, huge honour"". ""Best British and I'm not even from here, so I feel so welcome in your midst,"" he added. Bafta rules state that films in this category ""must have significant creative involvement by individuals who are British"". Berger added that we ""live in a time of a crisis of democracy"", and ended his speech by quoting Leonard Cohen, saying: ""There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in."" Brody, collecting his best actor win, told the audience The Brutalist ""is really about the pursuit of leaving something meaningful"", while Corbet said he was ""humbled and very grateful"". The ceremony was hosted by David Tennant at London's Royal Festival Hall. The actor wore a kilt and opened the ceremony by belting out The Proclaimers' classic song, I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), joined by other stars including James McAvoy and Colman Domingo. In what has been an unpredictable awards season, the Baftas followed a similar pattern, with no single film sweeping the board, and several movies sharing the spoils. This was the third year in a row that no British stars won any of the four acting prizes at the most prestigious night in the British film calendar. Films that had multiple nominations but lost out on the night included A Complete Unknown, the Bob Dylan biopic starring Timothée Chalamet, Nosferatu, Blitz, Gladiator II and The Apprentice.  Emilia Pérez, the French-made film, about a dangerous Mexican drug lord who decides to leave the world of crime and live a new life as a woman, has been the subject of controversy in recent weeks. Offensive social media posts by its star, Karla Sofía Gascón, were unearthed. Some wondered if the saga would affect its chances. With 11 nominations, it ended up winning best international film alongside Zoe Saldaña's win. She is now a favourite to replicate her Bafta win at next month's Oscars.  On accepting the international film prize, the film's director, Jacques Audiard, thanked the cast, including Gascon, as did Saldaña. Kieran Culkin's win for a A Real Pain was widely expected. The award was collected by his co-star and the film's writer and director, Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg's film, about two cousins who explore their Jewish grandmother's roots in Poland, also picked up the award for best original screenplay. Actor and TV presenter Warwick Davis was awarded the Bafta Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Academy. He thanked his mother - his ""first agent"" and his ""wonderful wife Sammy who died almost a year ago"".  The In Memoriam segment, which honours those from the film community who we have lost in the past year, paid tribute to the likes of Dame Maggie Smith, James Earl Jones, David Lynch, Dame Joan Plowright and Donald Sutherland. Other winners included Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part 2, which won special effects and sound. Blockbuster musical film Wicked won best production design for Brits Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales. It was Crowley's first Bafta and his sixth nonmination, although Sandales has won twice previously. It also picked up best costume design. Aardman's latest Wallace and Gromit film, Vengeance Most Fowl, won best animation - perhaps surprisingly, it's the first time they have won this award. They also picked up the inaugural award for best children and family film.   West Belfast rap group Kneecap won the Bafta for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer. The Irish-language film is based on a semi-fictionalised account of how the band was formed. The film's English director, Rich Peppiatt, said on accepting the prize: ""Kneecap is more than a film, it's a movement,"" adding that everyone should have their language and culture respected. Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve story, a film about the life of the Superman star who was paralysed in a horse riding accident 10  years before his death in 2004, won best documentary. His children took to the stage to honour their late father.

US government tries to rehire nuclear staff it fired days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3nrx1dq5o,"The US government is trying to rehire nuclear safety employees it had fired on Thursday, after concerns grew that their dismissal could jeopardise national security, US media reported. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) workers were among hundreds of employees in the energy department who received termination letters.  The department is responsible for with designing, building and overseeing the US nuclear weapons stockpile. The terminations are part of a massive effort by President Donald Trump to slash the ranks of the federal workforce, a project he began on his first day in office, less than a month ago. US media reported that more than 300 NNSA staff were let go, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. That number was disputed by a spokesperson for the Department of Energy, who told CNN that ""less than 50 people"" were dismissed from NNSA. The Thursday layoffs included staff stationed at facilities where weapons are built, according to CNN.  The Trump administration has since tried to reverse their terminations, according to media outlets, but has reportedly struggled to reach the people that were fired after they were locked out of their federal email accounts. A memo sent to NNSA employees on Friday and obtained by NBC News read: ""The termination letters for some NNSA probationary employees are being rescinded, but we do not have a good way to get in touch with those personnel."" ""Please work with your supervisors to send this information (once you get it) to people's personal contact emails,"" the memo added. Last week, nearly 10,000 federal workers were let go across several agencies, according to multiple US outlets.  That figure was in addition to the estimated 75,000 workers who have accepted an offer from the White House to leave voluntarily in the autumn.  Trump is working to slash spending across the board, abroad and at home, and going so far as to call for eliminating the education department.  He is getting help from the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who, through an effort called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), has sent workers to comb through data at federal agencies and helped implement the ""buyout"" offer. Last week, the Trump administration ordered agencies to fire nearly all probationary employees, those who had generally been in their positions for less than a year and not yet earned job protection. That included the NNSA staff members. Altogether, the move could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of people.  Several of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the government's size and spending have been met with legal challenges.  More than 60 lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration since the president was inaugurated on 20 January.

At least nine dead in US floods and heavy rain,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wewj551q0o,"At least nine people have died over the weekend, as torrential downpours drenched parts of the south-eastern US, submerging roads and houses.  Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said eight people died in his state and suggested at a news conference on Sunday that the total could go up.  Hundreds of people stranded in flood waters, many stuck in their cars, had been rescued, and Beshear warned residents to ""stay off the roads right now and stay alive"".  In Georgia, the ninth death was recorded after a man lying in his bed was struck by an uprooted tree that crashed into his home.  Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina were under some type of storm-related alert this weekend. Almost all of those states suffered catastrophic damage in September from Hurricane Helene. Between the eight states, roughly 400,000 people were without power on Sunday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us.  A bulk of the death and destruction appears to have occurred in Kentucky, where a mother and her seven-year-old child and a 73-year-old man were among the dead. Some parts of Kentucky received up to 6in (15cm) of rain, National Weather Service figures show, resulting in ""widespread flooding issues"".  The rapid influx of rain caused river levels to quickly rise and trapped vehicles in feet of water, images posted online show.  Governor Beshear wrote on X that there were over 300 road closures.  He also said that he had written to the White House requesting an emergency disaster declaration and federal funds for impacted areas, according to the BBC's partner CBS News.  President Donald Trump approved the declaration on Sunday, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which he has suggested abolishing, to coordinate disaster relief efforts. Officials have cautioned that the worst of the flooding is not over yet.   ""The rivers are still going to rise,"" Eric Gibson, director of the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management, said during a Sunday briefing. ""The effects will continue for awhile, a lot of swollen streams and a lot of flooding going on,"" Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the NWS, said. In Obion County, Tennessee, heavy rains there caused a levee to break, ""resulting in rapid onset flooding"", a local NWS account said on X.  ""If you are in the area, GET TO HIGH GROUND NOW! This is a LIFE THREATENING situation,"" the post says.  The town of Rives along the Obion River was swamped with water from the breached levee.  Footage shows brown water rushing over rocks and past trees, as rescue workers in red boats drive by flooded homes.  West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued a state of emergency in 10 counties on Saturday and added another three counties to the list on Sunday. ""Please continue to be cautious,"" Morrisey said on X.  Kristi Noem, the newly installed head of the Department of Homeland Security, said she has been in contact with both Beshear and Morrisey, and left voicemails with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey. Fema is part of her department. ""While emergency management is best led by local authorities, we reinforced that DHS stands ready to take immediate action to offer resources and support,"" Noem said. Meteorologists have also warned that a polar vortex is making its way toward the northern Rocky Mountains and northern Plains in the middle of the countryand is expected to land this weekend. In Colorado, temperatures could drop to as low as 14F (-10C), with the city of Denver reportedly opening shelters for its homeless population this weekend.  US-Israeli talks follow President Trump's proposal - widely condemned internationally - to take over Gaza and move the Palestinians out. The Munich conference exposed tensions between the US and Europe over Nato and Ukraine - the BBC's Frank Gardner explains why this was a watershed in relations.

"From the Gulf of America to Fort Bragg, what's behind Trump's name changes?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwypzzey425o,"​​President Donald Trump has always understood the power of branding. As a celebrity businessman, he affixed his name to the facades of his skyscrapers and licensed his name to an array of products, from hotels to wines. Now, he is attempting his boldest branding campaign yet: America itself. On his first day back in office, he signed an order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. Denali, the indigenous name for the famed Alaskan peak, will revert back to Mount McKinley, a reference to the assassinated 19th century president.  Fort Bragg, which was named for a Confederate general until the military changed it to Fort Liberty, will again bear its original name – but this time attributed to a far less controversial soldier from World War Two. Trump is not the first US president to rename a monument. It was Barack Obama, a Democrat, who renamed Mount McKinley to its Native American name, Denali, after years of lobbying from Alaskans.  George W Bush, a Republican, renamed the Caribbean National Forest in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to the El Yunque National Forest in 2007, to reflect the US territory's heritage. And after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 sparked a national reckoning on race, Congress initiated a process to rename US military bases named after Confederate figures. In 2023, during Joe Biden's presidency, the Department of Defense renamed nine US military bases, including Fort Bragg. At the heart of these decisions is a desire to portray America, and its values, in a particular light. ""The act of naming is a way that presidents can reshape their vision of the nation,"" said Allison Prasch, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies political rhetoric. Trump's choices in his second term send a clear message about his priorities too, she said. ""It is elevating a very nationalist, imperialist vision of the United States,"" Ms Prasch said. Some of Trump's name choices are callbacks to America's expansionist age, when the prevailing ideology said that America had a God-given mission to expand from shore to shore.  Part of President William McKinley's legacy was his role in annexing Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines and Hawaii. In changing Denali's name, Trump said he wanted to honour McKinley because he ""made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent"". It's an ideology that seems to inform Trump today too, as he has also floated the idea of retaking the Panama Canal, which had once been under US control, buying Greenland and annexing Canada to become the ""51st state"". Meanwhile, renaming Fort Bragg is the latest in an ongoing debate over the legacy of the Confederacy – the coalition of southern states that seceded from the US over the issue of slavery and triggered the Civil War. During Trump's first administration, amid a national reckoning over racial injustice, Congress required the Pentagon to rename facilities named after Confederates and banned future military installations from being named after them. The move rankled Trump then, who tried to veto the measure and declared that ""our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with!"" Congress overrode him with bipartisan support. But historian Connor Williams, who served on the renaming committee that had recommended the name Bragg be removed in 2021, said that honouring the Confederacy is misguided.  ""What makes Confederates such bad topics for commemoration is that they have very little to redeem them,"" Williams said. ""They committed treason against the United States."" ""What we commemorate, what we celebrate, what public displays we make, where we place wreathes – the president does have that ability to signal what he thinks is important,"" he added. In 2023, the Biden administration changed Fort Bragg, named after Confederate general Braxton Bragg, to Fort Liberty. ""We seized this opportunity to make ourselves better and to seek excellence,"" Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue said at the renaming ceremony. ""That is what we always have done and always will do."" However, the name change prompted mixed feelings among lawmakers, former military personnel who spent time there, and the local community. ""I understand the reasoning behind the change, and I have to accept it because it's what the elected leadership has determined is in the best interest,"" Cumberland County Commissioner Jimmy Keefe said at the time according to local media. ""But I hate that so many people who have had positive experiences at Fort Bragg, who have had children born there, weddings there, that they will no longer have that tether of Fort Bragg in the name."" This week, Trump's new Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, restored the base's name to Fort Bragg.  But this time, he said the base will be named after Private First Class Roland Bragg, who fought in World War II, rather than a Confederate general. ""That's right,"" Hegseth said. ""Bragg is back."" Republican lawmakers representing the base expressed enthusiasm about the change. ""Renaming Fort Bragg for Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, who earned the Silver Star and Purple Heart in WWII, was always the right decision,"" North Carolina Senator Ted Budd wrote on Facebook. But nationally, many of Trump's name changes have proved controversial. A Marquette University poll suggested that 71% of US adults did not support changing the Gulf of Mexico's name, and just 29% supported it. Some of the changes have sparked debates about whose vision of American history should officially stand. A poll by Alaska Survey Research suggested 47% of Alaska's Trump's voters favoured the name change. But overall, Alaskans opposed the name change by a two-to-one margin, the Juneau Express reported. Democrats and Republicans in Alaska's legislature banded together to pass a resolution urging Trump not to change Denali's name. ""To officially change the name would not only dishonor those who have fought to protect Denali's legacy but also dismiss the voices of the Native communities whose roots are intertwined with this land,"" said Alaska Representative Maxine Dibert, a Democrat and a member of the indigenous Koyukon Athabascan community. Time will tell whether Trump's symbolic name changes endure. But the arguments about them shows no signs of abating. This week, the White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from the Oval Office this week because the wire service kept Gulf of Mexico in its popular style guide. AP executive editor Julie Pace called the decision ""alarming"" and said it violated the constitution's free speech rights. Meanwhile, Google - which now uses the name Gulf of America on its maps for US users - has begun deleting negative reviews of the name change. Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America might be a land (or water) grab on paper only, but its symbolism is undeniable, said Ms Prasch, the professor of political rhetoric at the University of Wisconsin. And it goes beyond geography to strike a chord about how the country views itself - and its history. ""I actually think that this is much more than renaming a body of water on a map,""  she said. ""It is a fundamentally rhetorical decision about how we think about the story of the nation."" Danielle Sassoon resigned after Trump's justice department ordered her to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. The US president ordered his staff to develop a response to countries with trade policies he says are unfair.  A conservative think tank set out a sweeping vision for governing that could influence Trump's next term. What influence has it had so far?

"US isolation threatens global democracy, warns Major",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwngxdd1vo,"Sir John Major has warned that democracy is under threat as the United States steps back from its leading role in the world. The former prime minister told the BBC that US President Donald Trump's policy of American ""isolation"" was creating a power vacuum that would embolden nations like Russia and China. Sir John, who was PM from 1990 to 1997, said the gains made since the collapse of the Soviet Union were now being reversed - and that there was ""no doubt"" Russia would invade elsewhere before long. He said that ""ugly nationalism"" growing concurrently was making for a ""very unsettled time"". His comments come as European leaders prepare for an emergency summit on Monday on the war in Ukraine.  US and Russian officials are due to open peace talks in the coming days despite concerns European nations including Ukraine were being locked out. Sir John also rejected US Vice-President JD Vance's recent criticism of Europe's record on free speech, suggesting the remarks should have been directed at the authorities in Moscow or Beijing. He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It's extremely odd to lecture Europe on the subject of free speech and democracy at the same time as they're cuddling [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.  ""In Mr Putin's Russia, people who disagree with him disappear, or die, or flee the country, or - on a statistically unlikely level - fall out of high windows somewhere in Moscow.""  Sir John said the world was changing and ""may not be reshaping in a way that is congenial to the West"".   He continued: ""Many of the gains we made over recent years, when the Soviet Union collapsed, are now being reversed and you see a very aggressive Russia again in Ukraine.  ""And if they were to succeed with their venture in Ukraine, no doubt they'd be elsewhere before too long. ""There is no doubt in my mind that democracy has been in modest decline over the last 18 years.  ""There is an ugly nationalism growing, mostly from the intolerant right… So it is a very unsettled time."" The former Conservative leader, who presided over a tumultuous time for the UK's economy, said he sympathised with the challenges the current Chancellor Rachel Reeves faced, but said the global situation may require more defence funding. ""It's very, very easy to say from outside government, 'I'd just do this and I'd spend all this money'.  ""I would prefer to say I would realise in my plans that we have to make a very material increase in the level of defence expenditure and do it as a priority as soon as it is credible to do so."" Speaking earlier on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK and Europe had to respond to US demands for them to pay more towards their ""collective defence"" in the face of ""greater threats"". He said the government would set out a roadmap to increase defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of the nation's economic output, but declined to offer a definitive timetable. Reynolds also played down divisions between the US and its allies over resolving the Ukraine conflict, insisting there was ""still a great deal of common ground"". Sir John has made public interventions on a number of issues in recent years, including Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which started in 2022. Shortly after the war began, he and another former prime minister, Gordon Brown, were among signatories of a petition calling for Putin to face a Nuremberg-style trial for war crimes over his actions in Ukraine. The president opened the Nascar season with a flyby and lap in front of the racing cars. It is having problems contacting people who were fired in Trump's blitz to shrink the federal workforce. It comes as Donald Trump's envoy says Europe will not be involved in peace talks to end the war.  Different narratives from senior US officials on the future of Ukraine have sown confusion in Europe - but was that perhaps the point?

JD Vance's blast at Europe ignores Ukraine and defence agenda,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9nmeyzkjo,"This year's Munich Security Conference (MSC) was supposed to be primarily about two things: how to end the war in Ukraine without giving in to Russia, and how Europe needed to boost its spending on defence. But the most senior American present, US Vice President JD Vance, used his time at the podium to talk about neither. Instead, he shocked delegates on Friday by roundly attacking Washington's allies, including Britain, in a blistering attack decrying misinformation, disinformation, and the rights of free speech. It was a very weird 20 minutes - one met largely with silence from delegates in the hall. Even a joke, ""if American democracy can survive 10 years of [climate campaigner] Greta Thunberg scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk"", failed to raise a single laugh. He accused European governments of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech. Vance's speech went down very badly - unequivocally badly. It was extraordinarily poorly judged. But who was it aimed at?  A US commentator said to me afterwards: ""That was all for US domestic consumption."" The vice president did, however, go on to meet the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who did his best to sound positive. The pair had ""a good conversation"", according to Zelensky, who said it marked ""our first meeting, not last, I'm sure"". The Ukrainian leader emphasised the need for Washington and Kyiv to speak more and work together ""to prepare the plan [on] how to stop Putin and finish the war"". ""We want, really, we want peace very much. But we need real security guarantees,"" Zelensky added. According to US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin also wants peace, but that is peace on his terms. Unless those have secretly changed,  they involve capitulation to Russia's demands and the permanent ceding of territory to Moscow. Vance's speech came days after President Trump effectively pulled the rug out from Ukraine's negotiating position by conceding, via his Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, that restoring Ukraine's territory to where it was before the first Russian invasion in 2014 is simply ""not realistic"". The US also dashed Kyiv's hopes of joining Nato, a key ambition of President Zelensky, and ruled out sending US troops to help protect Ukraine's borders from the next time Russia decides to invade. Ahead of the Munich conference Europe was stunned by news that Trump had held an apparently cordial 90-minute phone call with Putin, thus abruptly ending the West's three-year freeze in talking to the Russian leader that has been in place since the time of the 2022 invasion. The delegates in Munich are scheduled to focus on the war in Ukraine in a high-profile debate on Saturday. The fear in Munich amongst European leaders and their delegations is that in Donald Trump's rush to secure a peace deal in Ukraine, Putin will emerge victorious, stronger and planning to seize more parcels of land in Europe. The president opened the Nascar season with a flyby and lap in front of the racing cars. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says the UK could act as a ""bridge"" between the US and Europe. Sir John says US policy will embolden Russia and China, with gains since the fall of the Soviet Union being reversed.

Trump administration's mixed messaging on foreign policy leaves world guessing,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr0gkn1qlzo,"A cracked windscreen forced US Secretary of State Marco Rubio into a rapid U-turn as his plane, en route to the Munich Security Conference, had to turn back an hour into the flight. America's top diplomat, his senior officials and the travelling press returned to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington DC on Thursday night. But despite the mid-air scare the news was already firmly elsewhere. In Europe, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had stunned America's allies with a speech setting out what many saw as a series of concessions Ukraine would have to make to sign any peace deal with Russia brokered by President Trump. Hegseth said it was ""unrealistic"" to think Ukraine could win back its sovereign territory occupied by Russia, as was its demand for Nato membership, adding it was up to European and not US troops to keep the peace. Critics, including some Republicans in Washington, castigated the speech, saying it gave away all of Ukraine's leverage ahead of any negotiations. It was, they argued, a US capitulation to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""It's certainly an innovative approach to a negotiation to make very major concessions even before they have started,"" said former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who co-chairs the European Council on Foreign Relation, a think tank. The following day, Hegseth wound back some of what he had said. He clarified that all options were in fact still on the table for Trump to use as leverage between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""What he decides to allow or not allow is at the purview of the leader of the free world, President Trump,"" said Hegseth. However he added he had been ""simply pointing out realism"" and rejected the idea he had offered any undue concessions to Moscow. As for Rubio, the broken-down plane delayed his arrival in Munich, where his officials were briefing about his own priorities for the trip. The United States would work for a ""just and lasting peace"" in which European countries would take the lead in creating a ""durable security framework"", they said. European leaders are expected to meet in Paris on Monday for urgent talks aimed at ensuring that their countries are fully involved in any Ukraine peace negotiations. The US secretary of state's position contained no trace of laying out limits for Ukraine in the way the defence secretary had done. Then, also in the German city, Vice-President JD Vance said the US could use ""military tools of leverage"" to compel Russia to do a deal, appearing to contradict Hegseth who had said no US troops would be deployed to Ukraine. Later in the Oval Office, the fallout from Hegseth's speech was put to President Trump - along with the commentary of a Republican senator who described it as a ""rookie mistake"", like something a pro-Putin pundit could have written. Had Trump been aware of what Hegseth was going to say? ""Generally speaking, yeah, generally speaking I was,"" said the president. ""I'll speak to Pete, I'll find out,"" he added. The three days of to and fro gave some of the first major insights into Trump's evolving position on one of the most consequential issues he faces - Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and his vow to end the war - and also into how his administration is formulating and messaging its foreign policy. On the substance, Hegseth's speech – alongside Trump's lengthy statement about an apparently warm phone call with Putin aimed at starting negotiations with Ukraine - sent shockwaves through European capitals, despite Hegseth's attempts to row back. ""Any quick fix is a dirty deal,"" said the European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas of the prospect of a US-led deal with Russia that might leave Ukraine's voice on the sidelines. Then there is the question of the way US foreign policy under Trump was being communicated. What happened in Munich seemed to be partly an attempt by his senior officials to interpret and relay Trump's positions, but that effort resulted in sometimes explosive and often contradictory statements - some of which were then partly diluted or reversed. It is not yet clear how much this is the result of a new but ill-coordinated administration still clarifying its lines to take internally, as opposed to a deliberate feature of a presidency less concerned about officials freelancing with rhetoric, even if it sows some confusion, so long as they remain loyal to his final word. Trump's first term saw a series of high-profile sackings or resignations of top officials who contradicted or disagreed with him, including three national security advisers, two defence secretaries and a secretary of state. This time around, his appointments have been characterised more frequently by a willingness to show loyalty. Pete Hegseth, who had no previous experience running a military or government or agency, was a Fox News weekend presenter and former National Guard major who aligns strongly with Trump's thinking and agenda. His appointment was highly contested and scraped through its confirmation process with three Republican senators voting against him, seeing the result tied 50-50 with JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. As Trump said himself this week he was ""okay"" with the idea of taking Ukraine joining Nato off the negotiating table, calling it ""not practical"". Hegseth's comments were hardly out of line with the president's position - rather they were an amplification of it to an audience anxious to shore up Ukraine's negotiating position not weaken it. The challenge for those affected is that the precise position of US foreign policy is having to be divined. One of its features is uncertainty. This may well be deliberate - Donald Trump using the ""madman"" theory of foreign relations - often attributed to former Republican President Richard Nixon. This suggests that being powerful but unpredictable is a way to make allies stay close while coercing adversaries. It would also explain a sense of his own officials going rogue but within the parameters of Trump's broadly known positions. But as this theory's name suggests, it also carries considerable risks of mistakes or miscalculation in an already violent and uncertain world. Trump's recent proposals for Gaza – emptying it of its Palestinian population to build the ""Riviera of the Middle East"" under US ownership - were similarly permeated with confusion and contradiction. While his officials appeared to try to correct some of what he set out – as only ""temporary relocation"" for example –Trump later doubled down saying it would in fact be ""permanent"" with no right of return. As for Rubio - who wants the state department be the most influential government agency when it comes to Trump's decision-making - his colleagues' comments at Munich were already overshadowing his own. His smaller, replacement plane finally landed in Europe – windscreen intact but without the press pool on board, while most of the headlines were also going elsewhere. The US top envoy's talks in Israel followed President Trump's proposal - widely condemned internationally - to take over Gaza and move the Palestinians out. Kentucky has seen the worst effects of the rain thus far, reporting at least eight dead. The president opened the Nascar season with a flyby and lap in front of the racing cars. Sir John says US policy will embolden Russia and China, with gains since the fall of the Soviet Union being reversed.

One year on: Did democratic opposition in Russia die with Alexei Navalny?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgly78j5ny8o,"A year after Alexei Navalny's suspicious death in a Russian prison, his supporters have been helping choose a headstone for his grave in Moscow. ""It will be a place of hope and strength for all those who dream of the wonderful Russia of the future,"" says the opposition politician's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, quoting one of his best-known phrases. Revealing her shortlist of designs in a video last week, she hoped the grave would become somewhere that those who oppose Vladimir Putin go ""to remember they are not alone"".  Navalnaya now lives abroad, facing arrest if she were to return to Russia. Her words capture just how far ambitions have shrunk. For years, Alexei Navalny was Vladimir Putin's biggest political rival: charismatic and courageous. Today, even his lawyers have been jailed as ""extremists"" and a huge number of supporters have fled Russia for safety. Those who've stayed are mostly scared into silence. Now Vladimir Putin, far from being defeated by a ruinous war on Ukraine, looks like dictating the terms of a peace deal there alongside Donald Trump. So did Russia's democratic opposition and its dream of change die in an Arctic prison yard with Alexei Navalny? Ksenia Fadeeva was serving a nine-year sentence when the TV in her cell announced that Navalny was dead. He had collapsed in prison on his daily walk. ""I was in a stupor; I couldn't even speak,"" the activist remembers. ""It was a nightmare."" Ksenia was a political prisoner herself, labelled an ""extremist"" for her previous links to Navalny. She managed his HQ in her Siberian hometown, Tomsk, when Navalny tried to run against Putin in the 2018 presidential elections. He was blocked. Back then, Ksenia showed me how her car had been coated in paint and had its tyres slashed. On another day the door of her flat was sealed shut with foam glue, trapping her inside. The young activist shrugged all this off. It came with the territory. At that point, Putin had been squeezing the democratic life out of Russia for close to two decades. He'd moved from controlling the media to rigging elections and punishing protest. Then came poisoning and political assassination. This month also marks 10 years since Boris Nemtsov, another powerful voice of opposition, was killed. He was shot in the back close to the red walls of the Kremlin. Russia had annexed Crimea illegally the previous year and Putin's approval rating was still riding a wave of toxic nationalism. Critics like Nemtsov were publicly slurred as traitors. The politician's lifeless body, sprawled beneath fairy lights in the colours of the Russian flag, marked the start of a dark new era. Navalny did his best to breathe new life into Russia's beleaguered opposition. A master of social media and of the anti-corruption agenda, he had real appeal, especially to a younger crowd. But in 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent and almost died. ""I knew they could put you in prison, break up protests with batons, invent criminal charges. But poisoning with a chemical weapon?"" Ksenia Fadeeva remembers her shock at the attack. ""I thought there were some brakes on the system, but I was wrong."" When Navalny returned from treatment abroad, he was arrested at the airport. He would never walk free. In that environment, the lack of overt opposition within Russia is hardly surprising. ""I don't think there is any country in the world where many would risk years in prison for speaking out,"" Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent activist, wrote to me once from his own jail cell. Sentenced to 25 years for condemning Russian war crimes in Ukraine, Kara-Murza smarted at criticism of Russians for failing to stand up to Putin more firmly and failing to stop the full-scale invasion. Navalny was already in jail. A spattering of anti-war protests was quickly stamped out. ""Inside Russia, it's not a matter of there being no one with the charisma of Navalny,"" Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia-Eurasia Centre says, explaining the lack of any new leader since his death. ""We're talking about the complete criminalisation of opposition."" Last August, Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ksenia Fadeeva were taken from their cells and forcibly deported as part of a giant exchange of prisoners. The Kremlin was exporting dissent. By then, Navalny was dead. Ksenia believes that had he lived, even from abroad Navalny could have made a difference. ""Things would have been different if they'd let Navalny out in a swap. His voice would have been loud, the opposition would have had more influence"", she says. ""In today's tough conditions, I don't know where you find another leader like Navalny."" His team haven't stopped working in exile. One half lobbies Western governments for more effective sanctions, the others try to smash through the wall of Russian propaganda with exposés of Putin's entourage. Their latest film targets a powerful ally of Putin, Igor Sechin, arguing that Putin is only pretending to ""make Russia great"" while he and his cronies plunder the country's wealth. Such investigations used to spark real-life protests. Now those viewers still inside Russia can only watch via VPN and most dare not post comments. ""You can get a criminal charge now, just for lifting a finger,"" Ksenia Fadeeva points out, although the latest film was seen almost two million times in 10 days. Ksenia is sure most of that audience is in Russia. ""People haven't changed their views, they're still there. They definitely read and follow and watch,"" she says. ""But they can't protest. They're just surviving."" That's a word I hear often from activists: they describe Russian opposition forces in a kind of holding pattern. ""We can stick to our basic pro-democracy values and try to keep people safe for the future Russia,"" Anastasia Burakova argues, and her own ""Ark"" project tries to do just that. ""But nobody knows how to successfully finish this dictatorship."" But is there actually demand for that? ""Imagine asking: 'Do you support Vladimir Putin or do you want to go to jail for 15 years,'"" says Ksenia Fadeeva, mocking the value of conducting polling in an authoritarian regime. Others believe researchers do still have ways to take the social pulse, and they confirm that it's not set racing by Yulia Navalnaya and co. Navalny's widow has moral authority but nowhere near his political skills. ""All these… liberal figures have extremely low approval ratings,"" says academic Tatiana Stanovaya. Instead, she detects a consolidation of support for the Kremlin which she links to a surge in Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia. ""People see that we are very vulnerable and they have to choose the strongest player to rely on,"" the analyst explains. ""It's not because they like Putin or consider him a positive hero. It's because he can protect Russia in a very hostile environment."" No matter that Putin created that environment himself by going to war. It helps that Donald Trump now appears to be siding with Moscow: the US president once said he ""understood"" Russia's veto on Ukraine joining Nato. He now seems to have conceded that major condition, even before any peace talks. ""I think the war has further entrenched anti-Western sentiment,"" Dr Jade McGlynn of King's College suggests. ""I also don't really see evidence there's even a strong minority of Russians who are desirous of a liberal, Western-allied type of democracy."" ""I think the liberals… ultimately failed to convince."" There's a whole lot wrapped up in that line, including the economic pain and massive corruption Russians experienced as the USSR fell apart. It all helped make democracy a dirty word. For years, state TV has also been shouting into every living room that critics of Russia are its enemies, and Western agents. ""The Kremlin plays on a real fear, ingrained in Russian minds, that the West has been trying to ruin Russia, weaken and divide it,"" Tatiana Stanovaya argues. ""There is good soil for the Kremlin to work on."" Opposition forces are also deeply divided. Fierce rivalries and personality clashes that go back many years have intensified in exile and now frequently erupt into vicious and very public fights. ""We can debate after democracy in Russia begins, but for now we have the same goal and the same enemy: he's in the Kremlin,"" Anastasia Burakova voices the frustration of many that such scrapping is a dangerous distraction. That division is part of why Jade McGlynn thinks Russia's exiled activists might better be called ""dissidents"" than a political opposition. ""Politics is about practicality, otherwise you are a philosopher,"" she argues – and challenging those in power is impossible in Russia right now. Anastasia Shevchenko agrees. But just surviving Putinism isn't good enough for her. ""I hate when people still talk about the 'beautiful Russia of the future',"" the Russian activist quoted Alexei Navalny, when we met in a Kyiv coffee shop last month. ""You can't be happy next to destroyed cities where so many people were killed."" Other opposition figures insist on referring to ""Putin's war"", to suggest that most Russians are against the invasion - which infuriates Ukrainians. ""I think to claim that it's one man's war when you have 600,000 troops there and over three million in the defence industry, not including all the propagandists, is not convincing,"" Jade McGlynn is firm. But Anastasia Shevchenko struggles to focus on anything else. Whilst change within Russia remains ""very far away"", she sees Ukraine is in trouble now and she can help.  She's become a one-woman telephone exchange for Ukrainian soldiers held captive in Russia: prisoners of war, who can't call Ukrainian numbers from Russian jails, dial Anastasia's Russian mobile. She gets their mother or wife on another line and places the phones together so they can talk. ""If you can help Ukraine, you should do that,"" she believes. ""But we Russians are focused only on Russia and I don't understand it."" Still readjusting to life out of prison, and out of her country, Ksenia Fadeeva has shifted her own focus from politics to human rights for now, helping political prisoners. ""I still believe Russia has every chance of becoming a normal, free, peaceful European country,"" Ksenia Fadeeva insists. ""But the regime is far harsher now, more authoritarian."" Anastasia Shevchenko agrees, though she remembers the collapse of the USSR and concedes that history is unpredictable. ""You never know what happens. Things can change quickly. So you have to be ready."" But ready for what? The idea of Russia leaping from Putinism to liberal democracy looks less likely than ever. Jade McGlynn sees no prospect at all, unless the vision that led to the invasion of Ukraine - ""this imperial, chauvinist vision of Russia"" – is defeated. ""I think that's where we will see real opposition,"" she thinks. ""From disgruntled nationalists,"" especially in a country with tens of thousands of war veterans and all their trauma. ""What will the authorities 'sell' to the people then? What idea?,"" Ksenia Fadeeva wonders, when the war is finally over. All agree the political repression will remain intense. As the analyst Tatiana Stanovaya puts it: ""The state, especially the repressive apparatus, do not have the skills to retreat."" On Sunday, Navalny's supporters plan memorials from Argentina to Australia to mark the anniversary of his death. In Moscow, some will visit his graveside. A few may dare to chant for change. But most of all, those who still cling to the dream of a democratic Russia will be checking who else is still out there. Still waiting.

US officials say direct talks with Russia - the first such talks since its invasion of Ukraine - will not involve Kyiv's European allies. Donald Trump's phone call with Putin has shocked both Ukraine's president Zelensky and allies alike, but is it enough to start peace talks? There has been no increase in radiation levels at the plant, Ukraine's president says. The 28-year-old is reportedly facing a potential jail term of 5-10 years on drug smuggling charges. It comes as Ukraine and its European allies are still reacting to Trump's phone call with Putin.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

"'Montoya, por favor!': Inside the Spanish reality show that broke the internet",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3wgwpd7r0o,"Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: ""Montoya, por favor!"" If you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island. Contestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids. In Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see. Forced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules.  Blind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (""Montoya, por favor!""), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky.  A second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness. ""This is cinema,"" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February.  ""Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane."" Yet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the ""completely unexpected"" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability. ""In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,"" he says. ""I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked. ""Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?"" The magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. ""Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,"" he says. Gonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a ""special man"". At 31, he told casters he'd ""never experienced love like this before"", having been with Anita ""every day for a year"". ""She's a strong woman with a lot of character,"" Gonzalo adds. The Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's ""authentic emotion"" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked. Seeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea. ""It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,"" Hulme says. ""We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?"" Alongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel ""predictable"" adds Hulme. A curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media.  A previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK. After Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: ""They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen"".  When asked why, she simply replied: ""people would complain"". Like Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom. A heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints.  Despite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot. ""Not everything we record is aired,"" he says. ""We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content."" Temptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows. Take Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes. So is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain?  When I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes. ""As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,"" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards. In the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants. When I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming. Montoya received particular support after his beach escapade.  ""We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,"" he says. Looking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month.  Gonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: ""My team deserve all the awards!"" Kim began her career as a child actor and was seen as one of the country's most promising actresses. The streaming giant will now hold its event on Sunday night at The Twenty Two, a luxury London hotel. The TV presenter posted screenshots of the exchanges on the fifth anniversary of Flack's death. Bracknell Forest Council wants to invest in its libraries and the renovation of the town centre. Senior Netflix boss says it is a shame historic offensive tweets by film's star have distracted from it.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

'This battle is my 9 to 5 - I won't stop until I have my £620m of Bitcoin back',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdl6er0369o,"It has been more than a decade since James Howells' hard drive - containing Bitcoin now worth hundreds of millions of pounds - ended up on a landfill site.  But despite facing numerous setbacks, he is determined to continue on his mission to retrieve it. ""This is my job, if you will. My 9 to 5,"" he said, adding he would ""absolutely not"" give up. The value of the cryptocurrency has dramatically increased in recent months, and with the hard drive currently worth about £620m, Mr Howells said ""it makes sense for me to focus my energy on this"" - although he does do some other work with crypto currencies.  Mr Howells, from Newport, claimed his ex-partner mistakenly threw out the hard drive, containing 8,000 bitcoins, in 2013, with it ending up in a tip owned by Newport City Council.  Last month, a High Court judge threw out his efforts to access the landfill or get £495m in compensation, saying there were no ""reasonable grounds"" for bringing the claim and ""no realistic prospect"" of succeeding at a full trial. He is now planning a case – representing himself using artificial intelligence to support his claim – at the Court of Appeal. He has also expressed interested in buying the site after the council said it planned to close it in the 2025-26 financial year.  Newport council said it was making no further comment on the matter. Mr Howells was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, mining the Bitcoin in 2009 when it was a small fraction of its current value. He has said that his former partner accidentally dumped the hard drive – about the size of a mobile phone – containing a Bitcoin wallet in 2013. As its value soared, he organised a team of experts to attempt to locate and recover it. He repeatedly asked permission from the council for access to the site, offering it a share of the missing Bitcoin if it was successfully recovered. After Mr Howells launched legal proceedings, the council applied for a High Court hearing to ask a judge to dismiss the claim before going to trial – which the judge did last month. The council argued its environmental permits would forbid any attempt to excavate the site for the search and previously said such work ""would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area"". Unwilling to give up, Mr Howells now believes he has two options open to him to retrieve the digital wallet – launch a case at the Court of Appeal, or work with investors to try to buy the landfill site from the council, after it announced the site is ""coming to the end of its life"" and it plans to close it within the next two years. Mr Howells told BBC News he was pleased with the work his legal team had done in the High Court trial, but that he would now be representing himself in a case filed with the Court of Appeal – using an ""artificial intelligence agent"" to assist his claim. He described AI as ""an absolutely amazing technology"" that had helped him better understand court processes and the law, and that he believed he had about seven ""solid grounds in law"" for his case, which he hopes to be able to present in-person to the Court of Appeal. One of the arguments in his case will centre on the council's plans to close the site, something he argued should have been revealed during the High Court trial. ""That is material information that should have been made [at the trial] – the judge should have been aware of that, as well as myself,"" he said. Mr Howells also said buying and fully excavating the site would save the council what he argued were significant maintenance costs once the site closes. ""Every single piece would be extracted or recycled, and at the end of the process we would have a hard drive in our hands - and we would also have an empty landfill,"" he said. In the High Court trial, the council also argued that the hard drive became its property as soon as it entered the landfill site, but Mr Howells said this failed to take into account the fact it was his ex-partner who threw it out. ""It was taken without my permission or consent,"" he said. Mr Howells said he was also exploring the option of buying the site from the council, adding he had ""preliminary agreements"" with investors – including those in the Middle East and the United States – who could make funding available if he had permission to buy the site. ""They're not just going to put millions of quid in my back pocket... but if the council show a willingness to sell the site, then the funding will be available,"" he said. The council has made no indication it is interested in selling the site and, as part of its closure, has secured planning permission for a solar farm on part of the land. Having spent many years pursuing it, including opening legal cases, Mr Howells said he was certain the hard drive remained on the landfill, which holds more than 1.4 million tonnes of waste. He said he had done his ""due diligence and research"", having spoken to a site manager at the landfill. ""Anything that was put into that site is still there. So, where else could it be?"" Asked if he would ever give up his mission to retrieve it, he said: ""Absolutely not. This is like the final battle in Braveheart."" Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual or digital currency that has no physical form. Bitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit.  Satoshis are named after Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto – believed to be a pseudonym – who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008. Those investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a ""very small"" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter. Bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being ""very quickly enamoured with it"", Mr Bambrough said. Prices began to rise in about 2016 and 2017, and again in 2020 during the Covid pandemic when ""stock markets, cryptocurrencies and meme coins went up hugely"". ""A lot of people got very rich, but a lot of people also lost money,"" Mr Bambrough said. The cryptocurrency also saw rapid increases in late 2024, shortly after Donald Trump's victory in the US general election, with his administration being seen as far friendlier towards cryptocurrencies than the Biden White House. ""A lot of people in the crypto and Bitcoin worlds say the price has gone up so much in such a short amount of time, they claim it could go higher and higher,"" Mr Bambrough said. ""So I can understand why James [Howells] is keen to find his Bitcoin."" The non-hierarchical group live communally and are dedicated to sustainable living.

Trump administration's mixed messaging on foreign policy leaves world guessing,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr0gkn1qlzo,"A cracked windscreen forced US Secretary of State Marco Rubio into a rapid U-turn as his plane, en route to the Munich Security Conference, had to turn back an hour into the flight. America's top diplomat, his senior officials and the travelling press returned to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington DC on Thursday night. But despite the mid-air scare the news was already firmly elsewhere. In Europe, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had stunned America's allies with a speech setting out what many saw as a series of concessions Ukraine would have to make to sign any peace deal with Russia brokered by President Trump. Hegseth said it was ""unrealistic"" to think Ukraine could win back its sovereign territory occupied by Russia, as was its demand for Nato membership, adding it was up to European and not US troops to keep the peace. Critics, including some Republicans in Washington, castigated the speech, saying it gave away all of Ukraine's leverage ahead of any negotiations. It was, they argued, a US capitulation to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""It's certainly an innovative approach to a negotiation to make very major concessions even before they have started,"" said former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who co-chairs the European Council on Foreign Relation, a think tank. The following day, Hegseth wound back some of what he had said. He clarified that all options were in fact still on the table for Trump to use as leverage between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""What he decides to allow or not allow is at the purview of the leader of the free world, President Trump,"" said Hegseth. However he added he had been ""simply pointing out realism"" and rejected the idea he had offered any undue concessions to Moscow. As for Rubio, the broken-down plane delayed his arrival in Munich, where his officials were briefing about his own priorities for the trip. The United States would work for a ""just and lasting peace"" in which European countries would take the lead in creating a ""durable security framework"", they said. European leaders are expected to meet in Paris on Monday for urgent talks aimed at ensuring that their countries are fully involved in any Ukraine peace negotiations. The US secretary of state's position contained no trace of laying out limits for Ukraine in the way the defence secretary had done. Then, also in the German city, Vice-President JD Vance said the US could use ""military tools of leverage"" to compel Russia to do a deal, appearing to contradict Hegseth who had said no US troops would be deployed to Ukraine. Later in the Oval Office, the fallout from Hegseth's speech was put to President Trump - along with the commentary of a Republican senator who described it as a ""rookie mistake"", like something a pro-Putin pundit could have written. Had Trump been aware of what Hegseth was going to say? ""Generally speaking, yeah, generally speaking I was,"" said the president. ""I'll speak to Pete, I'll find out,"" he added. The three days of to and fro gave some of the first major insights into Trump's evolving position on one of the most consequential issues he faces - Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and his vow to end the war - and also into how his administration is formulating and messaging its foreign policy. On the substance, Hegseth's speech – alongside Trump's lengthy statement about an apparently warm phone call with Putin aimed at starting negotiations with Ukraine - sent shockwaves through European capitals, despite Hegseth's attempts to row back. ""Any quick fix is a dirty deal,"" said the European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas of the prospect of a US-led deal with Russia that might leave Ukraine's voice on the sidelines. Then there is the question of the way US foreign policy under Trump was being communicated. What happened in Munich seemed to be partly an attempt by his senior officials to interpret and relay Trump's positions, but that effort resulted in sometimes explosive and often contradictory statements - some of which were then partly diluted or reversed. It is not yet clear how much this is the result of a new but ill-coordinated administration still clarifying its lines to take internally, as opposed to a deliberate feature of a presidency less concerned about officials freelancing with rhetoric, even if it sows some confusion, so long as they remain loyal to his final word. Trump's first term saw a series of high-profile sackings or resignations of top officials who contradicted or disagreed with him, including three national security advisers, two defence secretaries and a secretary of state. This time around, his appointments have been characterised more frequently by a willingness to show loyalty. Pete Hegseth, who had no previous experience running a military or government or agency, was a Fox News weekend presenter and former National Guard major who aligns strongly with Trump's thinking and agenda. His appointment was highly contested and scraped through its confirmation process with three Republican senators voting against him, seeing the result tied 50-50 with JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. As Trump said himself this week he was ""okay"" with the idea of taking Ukraine joining Nato off the negotiating table, calling it ""not practical"". Hegseth's comments were hardly out of line with the president's position - rather they were an amplification of it to an audience anxious to shore up Ukraine's negotiating position not weaken it. The challenge for those affected is that the precise position of US foreign policy is having to be divined. One of its features is uncertainty. This may well be deliberate - Donald Trump using the ""madman"" theory of foreign relations - often attributed to former Republican President Richard Nixon. This suggests that being powerful but unpredictable is a way to make allies stay close while coercing adversaries. It would also explain a sense of his own officials going rogue but within the parameters of Trump's broadly known positions. But as this theory's name suggests, it also carries considerable risks of mistakes or miscalculation in an already violent and uncertain world. Trump's recent proposals for Gaza – emptying it of its Palestinian population to build the ""Riviera of the Middle East"" under US ownership - were similarly permeated with confusion and contradiction. While his officials appeared to try to correct some of what he set out – as only ""temporary relocation"" for example –Trump later doubled down saying it would in fact be ""permanent"" with no right of return. As for Rubio - who wants the state department be the most influential government agency when it comes to Trump's decision-making - his colleagues' comments at Munich were already overshadowing his own. His smaller, replacement plane finally landed in Europe – windscreen intact but without the press pool on board, while most of the headlines were also going elsewhere. US-Israeli talks follow President Trump's proposal - widely condemned internationally - to take over Gaza and move the Palestinians out. Kentucky has seen the worst effects of the rain thus far, reporting at least eight dead. The president opened the Nascar season with a flyby and lap in front of the racing cars. Sir John says US policy will embolden Russia and China, with gains since the fall of the Soviet Union being reversed. It is having problems contacting people who were fired in Trump's blitz to shrink the federal workforce. Copyright 2025 BBC.

The A-level student who became an enemy of the Chinese state,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93lp2wd0qzo,"Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents. The choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($100,000; £105,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad. ""I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,"" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. ""But I've ended up with a bounty!"" Chloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago. In 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels. Her protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the café in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest. Hong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her – in which she is aged 11. ""It freaked me out at first,"" she says, but then she fired back a public response. ""I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them."" Chloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997. ""Politics were never in my life before… so I went to the first protest with curiosity,"" she said. She saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck. ""I was so shocked,"" she says. ""That moment actually changed how I looked at the world."" Growing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms – she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about ""what we like and don't like"" and  ""could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like"". But the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge. ""I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],"" she says. But when things started to get ""really crazy"",  she browbeat her parents into coming with her. At the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the ""raw experience"", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV. After months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. Suddenly, most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies – were gone. Symbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail. In response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown. At first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around. Unable to afford international student fees of more than £20,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO. When China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians. Chloe, still finishing her A-levels at the time, thought was she too small-fry to ever be a target. Her inclusion underlines Beijing's determination to pursue activists overseas. The bounty puts a target on her back and encourages third parties to report on her actions in the UK, she says. China has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week.  Another Hong Kong dissident who reported being assaulted in London blamed the attacks on Chinese government-linked actors. And last May, British police charged three men with gathering intelligence for Hong Kong and breaking into a home. One of the men was soon after found dead in unclear circumstances. ""They're only interested in Hong Kongers because they want to scare off others,"" Chloe says. She says many of those who've moved over in recent years stay quiet, partly because they still have family in Hong Kong. ""Most of the BNO visa holders told me this because they don't want to take risks,"" she says. ""It's sad but we can't blame them."" On the day her arrest warrant was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not tolerate ""any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas"". He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK. But more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster. In the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: ""We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK.""  But she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers. ""We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China."" Does she feel scared on the streets in London? It's not as bad as what activists back home face, she says.  ""When I think of what [they] face… it's actually not that big a deal that I got a bounty overseas.""

"Austria attack that killed teen linked to IS, officials say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4jj0p5jdo,"A stabbing in Austria that killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five others was an Islamist attack, Austrian officials have said.  The attack took place on Saturday at Villach, a town near the border with Italy and Slovenia, and three of those who were injured remain in intensive care, authorities said.  A 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker, who was detained at the scene, has been charged with murder and attempted murder.   Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said an Islamic State group flag had been found in the suspect's apartment, while state police chief Michaela Kohlweiss said he had sworn allegiance to the group. Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Karner said this was an ""Islamist attack with IS links by an attacker who, according to the investigations so far, was obviously radicalised online, via the internet, within a very short space of time"".  ""So those in a position of responsibility, the police, the authorities, must draw the necessary conclusions from that."" Karner said the suspect had a valid residence permit, no criminal record, and had not previously attracted the attention of authorities.  Authorities previously said the suspect had a temporary residence permit and was waiting for a decision on his asylum application. The attack took place around 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) near the town's main square.  On Sunday, officials confirmed the ages of those who were injured: Two 15-year-olds, with the other victims aged 28, 32 and 36. Five of them are Austrian nationals and one is Turkish. Three are in intensive care, one is in a stable condition and another is receiving outpatient treatment. A delivery worker, also a Syrian man, who had driven his vehicle at the attacker helped prevent more injuries, police said. The attack comes amid a national debate over asylum laws and an election last year that saw the far-right Freedom Party come out on top for the first time. The party has failed to form a coalition government, leaving Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen weighing up whether to call a snap election, form a minority government or invite other parties or a group of experts to try and form an administration. Herbert Kickl, the head of the Freedom Party, seized on the Villach attack, saying on Saturday that Austria needs a ""rigorous crackdown on asylum"". On Sunday, Karner said there needed to be ""legal reforms"" for police and authorities and called for screenings of certain groups, such as asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan.

Angry neighbours dub inflatable dome 'enormous zit',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpj82j7qqo,"A giant inflatable dome which has been likened to a huge bouncy castle has caused uproar in an upmarket area of Edinburgh.   Residents in Stockbridge have dubbed the structure an ""enormous zit"", blighting the views of the area's picturesque Georgian architecture. And some locals say they are being kept awake by noise and vibrations from the electric fans used around the clock to keep the dome inflated.  The dome, which houses tennis courts, was erected at a private sports club last October, after the Scottish government overruled a City of Edinburgh Council decision to reject the plans.  Now residents have launched a petition demanding ""visual adjustments"" and soundproofing for the fans while others have called for it to be taken down. They say it is a ""monstrous blight"" in a conservation area which is close to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Edinburgh's Old Town. The Grange Club has not responded to requests to comment.  Claire Baxter, 45, who lives locally, told BBC Scotland News she was shocked when she saw the dome. ""It's horrendous and looks like an enormous zit. Every time I walk past it I cannot believe it's been allowed.  ""Everyone in the neighbourhood has been talking about it for months."" Keith Hughes, who lives in a house beside the inflatable, likened it to having a version of London's Millennium Dome (now the O2) outside his window. ""I am awake every single night with the low hum of the background fans keeping the tennis court roof inflated. ""They have totally disregarded their heritage. They should be ashamed of themselves for the impact on this world heritage area. They have had no consideration for the local people."" The 57-year-old said he was now planning to move house after enjoying three years in the ""beautiful"" suburb. And he contrasted the dome with the category A-listed cricket pavilion at The Grange Club, which is home to the Scotland national cricket team. ""You have this lovely grandstand since 1892, which looks in place and then you have this ugly monolith that dominates the skyline and jars the eye, it's hideous, how have they got away with this? It's a nightmare."" Mr Hughes, an IT programme manager, added: ""This only benefits a very select few who are members of the Grange Club and who don't even live next door to it."" It is not clear from planning documents how long The Grange Club intends to keep the inflatable structure. Residents believe it is now permanent.  The application to erect the structure was initially rejected by planners with City of Edinburgh Council but it was then appealed to the Scottish government.  Scottish government reporter, Andrew Fleming - an official appointed by ministers - overruled the council's decision, paving the way for the dome to be constructed. He said he allowed it for public benefit because there were a lack of indoor tennis facilities in Edinburgh. Jacquie Christie said her 80-year-old mother, who has lived in the same house for 50 years, could feel vibrations from the powerful fans and it was ""horrendous"". ""The stress it's caused her, every morning when she gets up and looks out into the garden and that's her view,"" said the 58-year-old. ""She is really devastated over what they have done without a second thought or communication."" Ms Christie said she was baffled how the ""jumpy castle"" got the go ahead when her mother had to go to three different appeal panels just to get double glazing installed. Local resident Sarah Hill said she could hear the hum of the fans, as well as players calling to each other and whacking balls.  She also described the dome as ""very overpowering"". Ms Hill added: ""The whole application proposal needs to be flagged up over the fact it was against the community wishes and was rejected by the city council but was overturned on the decision of one reporter. ""It's not right and the process really needs to be addressed. ""None of us were consulted. I heard about it from someone on the community council. ""It is extremely ugly and is a big eyesore out with the keeping of the conservation zone."" Another resident who overlooks the inflatable said she had stopped looking out of her windows because it dominated her view and upset her so much. Meanwhile Lady Jennifer Bute, who has a house beside the structure, said she thought it was ""objectionable"". ""I think they need to paint it a different colour to make it more invisible,"" she added. Max Mitchell, an Edinburgh councillor whose ward covers the tennis court, said: ""It's another frustrating example of a Scottish government civil servant overruling the decision of democratically elected and accountable councillors. ""The concerns around the impact on the conservation and residential amenity have sadly come true for those living nearby. ""I can understand why residents are unhappy especially when the applicant was allowed a second bite at the cherry via an appeal."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The right to appeal certain decisions made by local planning authorities is an important part of the planning system. ""The decision was issued by an independent reporter, who is required to make their decision on the planning merits of the case, taking full account of submissions made by all parties, including those from members of the local community."" The company said the shops were set to be shut as part of a wider restructuring plan. He is the second person to be interviewed about the ""devastating"" scene in a Hampshire village. Dozens of hare and bird corpses were scattered in front of a community shop on Friday. Dozens of hare and bird corpses were scattered in front of Broughton Community Shop.

Why Uganda's iconic crested crane faces extinction,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21r7qd16ro,"With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms. All the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it. The bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; £4m) for those found to have killed one. Going back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity. It was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died. ""Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,"" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC. But for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them. ""I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,"" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC. Another farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard. ""We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,"" she told the BBC. Also known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. They are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather. Standing at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates. But with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home. ""In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,"" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC. In the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda. This decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012. ""Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,"" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC. Around Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn.  Conservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara. Dozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda. ""One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,"" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC. Mr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes. Farmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides. ""I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,"" he told the BBC. However, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible. ""It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,"" he told the BBC. Sarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles. Cranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment. ""Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,"" Ms Kugonza told BBC. Their exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi. But crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful. ""It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,"" said Mr Muheebwa. They attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it. Scientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days. Any destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns. Their monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck. ""Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,"" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said. This is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes. And in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands. President Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation. The ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected. Nature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained ""very low"". For Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law. ""We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,"" he said.

The A-level student who became an enemy of the Chinese state,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93lp2wd0qzo,"Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents. The choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($100,000; £105,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad. ""I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,"" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. ""But I've ended up with a bounty!"" Chloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago. In 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels. Her protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the café in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest. Hong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her – in which she is aged 11. ""It freaked me out at first,"" she says, but then she fired back a public response. ""I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them."" Chloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997. ""Politics were never in my life before… so I went to the first protest with curiosity,"" she said. She saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck. ""I was so shocked,"" she says. ""That moment actually changed how I looked at the world."" Growing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms – she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about ""what we like and don't like"" and  ""could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like"". But the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge. ""I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],"" she says. But when things started to get ""really crazy"",  she browbeat her parents into coming with her. At the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the ""raw experience"", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV. After months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. Suddenly, most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies – were gone. Symbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail. In response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown. At first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around. Unable to afford international student fees of more than £20,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO. When China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians. Chloe, still finishing her A-levels at the time, thought was she too small-fry to ever be a target. Her inclusion underlines Beijing's determination to pursue activists overseas. The bounty puts a target on her back and encourages third parties to report on her actions in the UK, she says. China has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week.  Another Hong Kong dissident who reported being assaulted in London blamed the attacks on Chinese government-linked actors. And last May, British police charged three men with gathering intelligence for Hong Kong and breaking into a home. One of the men was soon after found dead in unclear circumstances. ""They're only interested in Hong Kongers because they want to scare off others,"" Chloe says. She says many of those who've moved over in recent years stay quiet, partly because they still have family in Hong Kong. ""Most of the BNO visa holders told me this because they don't want to take risks,"" she says. ""It's sad but we can't blame them."" On the day her arrest warrant was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not tolerate ""any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas"". He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK. But more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster. In the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: ""We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK.""  But she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers. ""We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China."" Does she feel scared on the streets in London? It's not as bad as what activists back home face, she says.  ""When I think of what [they] face… it's actually not that big a deal that I got a bounty overseas.""

'We quit our jobs and sold our house to travel the world with the kids',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c897j2jl5kxo,"A couple who ""risked it all"" by quitting their jobs and selling their home to travel the world with their three children said the adventure had saved them as a family. Chris and Tamira Hutchinson were ""living from pay cheque to pay cheque"" and barely spent any time together at home in Corby, Northamptonshire. They sold their three-bedroom house almost two years ago and drove straight to the airport to start their new life with their three daughters, Olivia, 10, Scarlett, eight, and Bella, four. ""As a family, we were pretty much broken. But now we are living our dream,"" Chris says. Despite working ""every hour under the sun"" – Chris as a personal trainer and Tamira as a swimming teacher - they could not keep up with the cost of living in the UK. ""We went down to one car, we got rid of Sky TV, we didn't go on holiday but the bills kept going up and up,"" says Tamira. ""We only ate together as a family once a month because we didn't get time. We were just working to make ends meet."" It was during Covid that they first talked about selling up and travelling the world. ""We had a chance to breathe and we realised we didn't want to go back to the life we were living,"" Chris says. The couple put their house up for sale in 2022 but it took longer to sell than they anticipated and they nearly backed out of the plan. When it finally sold in May 2023, they drove straight to Heathrow. ""Our last night in the house, we were all on the floor because we had sold all our furniture,"" says Chris.  ""We didn't have the money to book our flights until we got the cash from the house, so we went to a hotel near Heathrow and booked flights to Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia]. ""It was a huge risk. We thought it might not work and we might want to go home, but we've never looked back.""  Chris taught himself videography before they left so he could document their travels on social media, which has turned into their biggest source of income. ""We were already making videos about family life, but we didn't have a huge amount of followers,"" the 36-year-old explains. ""We had 7,000 subscribers on YouTube but now we have 100,000, and we had about 12,000 on TikTok where as now we have 250,000."" After exploring Malaysia, they went to Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and Qatar. It was during their trip to China that their social media ""blew up"" and the family ""accidentally became famous"" in the country. One video they made about their drinks being dropped off by a drone received eight million views on TikTok. They also saw a huge growth on Chinese social media platforms, where they have over one million followers and their videos reach tens of millions of views. The couple say the trip has been ""incredible"", but there have inevitably been tough times. Tamira got dengue fever in Thailand, their family credit card got swallowed by a machine in Vietnam and all five of them got a sickness bug while staying in a hostel in the Philippines. ""Another difficult time was when we got lost in China. We were walking round with all our possessions in the early hours of the morning and our phone maps didn't work. But we eventually found our hotel and we can laugh about it now,"" Tamira says. They have based themselves on the Malaysian island of Penang for the last few months, where their daughters, who are home schooled by Tamira, are ""thriving"". ""They are learning about different cultures, currencies, languages and how to get around,"" Chris says. ""All three of them have always been 110% on board with this idea, but if they ever changed their minds and wanted to go home, we would listen to them. ""They have grown in confidence so much and they make friends wherever they go. There are a lot of digital nomad families travelling round, who are working remotely."" The Hutchinsons say they have got the next five years planned out, with trips to Dubai, Australia, India, Sri Lanka and Cambodia on the cards this year. They might also go back to the UK briefly, but they have no plans at the moment to return permanently, because their ""quality of life is so much better now"". The couple receive lots of messages asking for advice and say they hope to inspire other parents. ""It's not flowers all the time but if you're a person who enjoys a challenge and enjoys spending time with your family, go for it. You will never know until you try,"" Tamira says. ""It was a dream and we made it happen,"" Chris adds. ""As a family we have loved every moment and we have risen to the challenges.""

"South Korean actress Kim Sae-ron, 24, found dead",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c626p25egddo,"South Korean actress Kim Sae-ron has been found dead in Seoul, police have said. The 24-year-old was found in her home in the city's Seongsu-dong district by a friend at around 16:55 (07:55 GMT) on Sunday. Officers said no signs of foul play had been found and they were investigating the cause of death. Kim began her career as a child actor and was seen as one of South Korea's most promising young actresses. Born in Seoul in 2000, she rose to prominence with her role in 2009 film A Brand New Life - which saw her appear at the Cannes Film Festival. She went on to star in South Korea's highest grossing film of 2010 The Man from Nowhere and 2012 thriller The Neighbour, for which she received award recognition. Other notable roles include the 2014 film A Girl at My Door and television roles such as Mirror of the Witch in 2016. The actress largely withdrew from the public eye in 2022 due to a drink driving incident, for which she was fined 20 million won (£11,000) in April 2023. Kim's last role was in Netflix's 2023 Korean drama Bloodhounds. Variety reported that most of her role was edited out due to the driving incident. Eyewitnesses and relatives of victims spoke of their pain and trauma after a crush at an overcrowded railway station claimed 18 lives. Hwang Ui-jo, who played for Nottingham Forest, was found guilty of illegally filming sexual encounters.

"Austria attack that killed teen linked to IS, officials say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4jj0p5jdo,"A stabbing in Austria that killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five others was an Islamist attack, Austrian officials have said.  The attack took place on Saturday at Villach, a town near the border with Italy and Slovenia, and three of those who were injured remain in intensive care, authorities said.  A 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker, who was detained at the scene, has been charged with murder and attempted murder.   Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said an Islamic State group flag had been found in the suspect's apartment, while state police chief Michaela Kohlweiss said he had sworn allegiance to the group. Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Karner said this was an ""Islamist attack with IS links by an attacker who, according to the investigations so far, was obviously radicalised online, via the internet, within a very short space of time"".  ""So those in a position of responsibility, the police, the authorities, must draw the necessary conclusions from that."" Karner said the suspect had a valid residence permit, no criminal record, and had not previously attracted the attention of authorities.  Authorities previously said the suspect had a temporary residence permit and was waiting for a decision on his asylum application. The attack took place around 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) near the town's main square.  On Sunday, officials confirmed the ages of those who were injured: Two 15-year-olds, with the other victims aged 28, 32 and 36. Five of them are Austrian nationals and one is Turkish. Three are in intensive care, one is in a stable condition and another is receiving outpatient treatment. A delivery worker, also a Syrian man, who had driven his vehicle at the attacker helped prevent more injuries, police said. The attack comes amid a national debate over asylum laws and an election last year that saw the far-right Freedom Party come out on top for the first time. The party has failed to form a coalition government, leaving Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen weighing up whether to call a snap election, form a minority government or invite other parties or a group of experts to try and form an administration. Herbert Kickl, the head of the Freedom Party, seized on the Villach attack, saying on Saturday that Austria needs a ""rigorous crackdown on asylum"". On Sunday, Karner said there needed to be ""legal reforms"" for police and authorities and called for screenings of certain groups, such as asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan.

PM 'ready' to put troops on ground in Ukraine to protect peace,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gxgxl3grgo,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he is ""ready and willing"" to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the UK prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was ""essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future"". Before attending an emergency summit with European leaders in Paris on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by ""putting our own troops on the ground if necessary"". ""I do not say that lightly,"" he wrote. ""I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."" The prime minister added: ""But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country."" The end of Russia's war with Ukraine ""when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again"", Sir Keir said. UK troops could be deployed alongside soldiers from other European nations alongside the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory. Sir Keir's announcement comes after the former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, told the BBC the UK military was ""so run down"" it could not lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. The PM has previously only hinted that British troops could be involved in safeguarding Ukraine after a ceasefire. He is due to visit President Donald Trump in Washington later this month and said a ""US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again"". Sir Keir is meeting with other European leaders in response to concerns the US is moving forward with Russia on peace talks that will lock out the continent. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days, US officials say. On Saturday the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said European leaders would be consulted only and not take part in any talks between the US and Russia. A senior Ukrainian government source told the BBC on Sunday that Kyiv has not been invited to talks between the US and Russia. Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the ""ridiculous war"" in Ukraine would begin ""immediately"". Trump then ""informed"" Zelensky of his plan. On Sunday, Trump said that he expected Zelensky to be involved in the talks. He also said he would allow European nations to buy US weapons for Ukraine. Asked by the BBC about his timetable for an end to fighting, Trump said only that ""we're working to get it done"" and laid the blame for the war on the previous administration's Ukraine policies. Writing in the Telegraph, Sir Keir said ""peace cannot come at any cost"" and ""Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations, because anything less would accept Putin's position that Ukraine is not a real nation"". He added: ""We cannot have another situation like Afghanistan, where the US negotiated directly with the Taliban and cut out the Afghan government - in reference to a deal negotiated by Trump's first administration, which was later enacted by the Biden administration. ""I feel sure that President Trump will want to avoid this too,"" said Sir Keir Sir Keir said Ukraine's path to Nato membership was ""irreversible"" and European nations ""must increase our defence spending and take on a greater role"" in the alliance. The UK currently spends around 2.3% of GDP on defence and has committed to increase defence spending to a 2.5% share of the economy, without giving a timeframe for this. Trump has called for Nato members to spend 5% of GDP on defence, while Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has suggested allies should spend more than 3%. Lord Dannatt - who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2009 - told the BBC up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed on rotation for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine and ""we just haven't got that number available"". He said, in total, a force to keep the peace would require about 100,000 troops on the ground and the UK would have to supply ""quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it"". The meeting in Paris called by French President Emmanuel Macron will see Sir Keir joined by leaders from Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark along with the presidents of the European Council and European Commission, and Rutte. Sir Keir Starmer says the figure is a ""shot in the arm"", but ""the job isn't done"" to bring down waiting lists. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says the UK could act as a ""bridge"" between the US and Europe. Sir John says US policy will embolden Russia and China, with gains since the fall of the Soviet Union being reversed. It comes as Donald Trump's envoy says Europe will not be involved in peace talks to end the war.  Different narratives from senior US officials on the future of Ukraine have sown confusion in Europe - but was that perhaps the point? Copyright 2025 BBC.

"Ukraine not invited to US-Russia peace talks, source tells BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm292319gr2o,"Kyiv has not been invited to talks between the US and Russia aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian government source has told the BBC. The US special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg had said Kyiv would be involved in Monday's talks in Saudi Arabia, but the source said no delegation would be present. European leaders have also not been asked to join the discussions, and are due to meet instead on Monday in Paris at a summit hastily arranged by the French president, as fears grow the continent is being locked out of negotiations. The separate meetings follow a turbulent week where Washington has signalled a drastic change in its approach to the war in Ukraine. The White House's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed he was travelling to Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening for the first face-to-face talks between the US and Russia towards ending the conflict. US President Donald Trump revealed on Sunday that Witkoff had met with Putin already ""for a very extended period, like about three hours"". Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer and friend of Trump, was in Moscow this week to secure the release of a US teacher imprisoned on charges of marijuana possession. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz are also set to meet Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia, less than a week after Trump held a phone call with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin.  The call on Wednesday brought to an end a three-year freeze on direct contact between Moscow and Washington.  Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out accepting a peace deal negotiated without Ukraine, telling US television network NBC on Sunday that he would ""never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine, never"". Witkoff said US officials were speaking separately with Ukrainian officials and that it was ""part of the talks"" - but did not indicate whether he expected Kyiv to be present in Saudi Arabia. Trump told reporters in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday he expected Zelensky to be involved in the talks. He also said he would allow European nations to buy US weapons for Ukraine. Asked by the BBC when he believed any peace negotiations could bear fruit and end the fighting, Trump said only that ""we're working to get it done"" and laid the blame for the war on the previous administration's Ukraine policies. Meanwhile, Rubio downplayed the Saudi Arabia talks, saying one meeting would not solve the war and that a formal negotiating process - that would mediate between Ukraine, Russia and third parties - had not yet been set up. He told CBS News, however, that the next few days would determine if Putin was serious about achieving peace. It is against this backdrop that a group of European leaders - including the UK's Keir Starmer, Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte, Germany's chancellor Olaf Scholz and the European Commission's Ursula von der Leyen - will meet in Paris. French President Emmanuel Macron will hold an informal meeting in the afternoon on Ukraine and European security. Ahead of the summit, Sir Keir said the UK was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by ""putting our own troops on the ground if necessary"". Writing in the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper, the prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine ""is essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future"". US Ukraine envoy Kellog had earlier dismissed concerns over Europe not being invited to Saudi Arabia, arguing previous negotiations had failed due to the involvement of too many parties. ""It may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest,"" he said on Saturday. The meetings mark an acceleration in Trump's efforts to achieve a swift end to the war. The White House said the US president had held a ""lengthy"" phone-call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, after which Trump said negotiations to stop the ""ridiculous war"" in Ukraine would begin immediately. He also said it was not ""practical"" for Ukraine to join Nato and ""unlikely"" it could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders. Ukraine has repeatedly called for Nato membership and has rejected ceding territory as part of any peace deal. Trump's stance has also been echoed by his defence secretary, fuelling European alarm that the US may be making concessions to Russia before any peace deal was negotiated. Pete Hegseth also said European nations must provide the ""overwhelming"" share of funding for Ukraine - claiming the US would no longer ""tolerate an imbalanced relationship"" with its allies.  US Vice-President JD Vance likewise told the Munich Security Conference on Friday that Europe must ""step up in a big way to provide for its own defence"", in his speech largely spent criticising European democracies. Zelensky called on Saturday for the creation of a European army, arguing the continent could no longer count on Washington. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine continued on Sunday - with Zelensky saying a Russian attack had left at least 100,000 people without power in Mykolaiv. He said homes were without heating following a drone strike on the city's ""critical infrastructure"". Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, having already seized Crimea and part of the eastern Donbas region in 2014. US-Israeli talks follow President Trump's proposal - widely condemned internationally - to take over Gaza and move the Palestinians out. Kentucky has seen the worst effects of the rain thus far, reporting at least eight dead. The president opened the Nascar season with a flyby and lap in front of the racing cars.

World's 'first openly gay imam' shot dead in South Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05l33j7rq7o,"Muhsin Hendricks, a pioneering figure dubbed the world's first openly gay imam, has been shot dead in South Africa. The 57-year-old cleric ran a mosque in Cape Town intended as a safe haven for gay and other marginalised Muslims. He was killed on Saturday morning after the car in which he was travelling near the southern city of Gqeberha was ambushed. ""Two unknown suspects with covered faces got out of the vehicle and started firing multiple shots at the vehicle,"" police said in a statement. News of Hendricks' death has sent shockwaves through the LGBTQ+ community and beyond, prompting an outpouring of tributes from across the globe. Julia Ehrt, executive director at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (Ilga), called on the authorities to thoroughly investigate ""what we fear may be a hate crime"". ""He supported and mentored so many people in South Africa and around the world in their journey to reconcile with their faith, and his life has been a testament to the healing that solidarity across communities can bring in everyone's lives,"" she said.   Hendricks was killed after he had reportedly officiated at a lesbian wedding, though this has not been officially confirmed. The details of the attack emerged through security footage that was shared on social media. It shows a car pulling up and blocking the vehicle in which Hendricks was travelling as it was pulling away from the curb. According to police, the imam was in the back seat. The angle of CCTV footage reveals what happened from one side of the road - an assailant jumps out of a car, runs to the ambushed vehicle and shoots repeatedly through the back passenger window. Hendricks' Al-Ghurbaah Foundation, which runs the Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque in the Wynberg suburb of Cape Town, confirmed he had died in a targeted attack on Saturday morning. But Abdulmugheeth Petersen, chair of the foundation's board, appealed via a WhatsApp group for their followers to be patient, stressing the importance of protecting Hendricks' family. Hendricks' work challenged traditional interpretations of Islam and championed a compassionate, inclusive faith. South Africa's post-apartheid constitution was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation and in 2006, became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage. But despite a thriving LGBT community, gay people still face discrimination and violence. The country also has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Hendricks came out as gay in 1996, which shocked the wider Muslim community in Cape Town and elsewhere. That same year, he founded The Inner Circle, an organisation providing support and a safe space for queer Muslims seeking to reconcile their faith and sexuality before going on to establish the inclusive Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque. He was the subject of a documentary in 2022 called The Radical, in which he said about the threats he faced: ""The need to be authentic was greater than the fear to die."" Hendricks often spoke about the importance of interfaith dialogue and the need to address the mental health issues and trauma faced by LGBTQ+ individuals within religious communities. He told the Ilga World Conference in Cape Town last year: ""It is important that we stop to look at religion as the enemy."" Reverend Jide Macaulay, an openly gay Anglican minister, described Hendricks' death as ""truly heartbreaking"". The British-Nigerian LGBTQ rights activist runs House of Rainbow, an organisation that provides support for gay people in Nigeria where same-sex relationships or public displays of affection are illegal, and paid tribute to Hendricks' bravery. ""Your leadership, courage, and unwavering dedication to inclusive faith communities have left an indelible mark,"" he said. Sadiq Lawal, a gay Muslim man living in Nigeria, told the BBC that Hendricks, had made such an impact as he had made ""the impossible possible"" by saying the words: ""I'm a queer imam."" ""He's a mentor to many queer Muslims in Africa, especially in Nigeria, because of religious extremism,"" he said. ""I'm still in shock and devastated.""

US government tries to rehire nuclear staff it fired days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3nrx1dq5o,"The US government is trying to rehire nuclear safety employees it had fired on Thursday, after concerns grew that their dismissal could jeopardise national security, US media reported. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) workers were among hundreds of employees in the energy department who received termination letters.  The department is responsible for with designing, building and overseeing the US nuclear weapons stockpile. The terminations are part of a massive effort by President Donald Trump to slash the ranks of the federal workforce, a project he began on his first day in office, less than a month ago. US media reported that more than 300 NNSA staff were let go, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. That number was disputed by a spokesperson for the Department of Energy, who told CNN that ""less than 50 people"" were dismissed from NNSA. The Thursday layoffs included staff stationed at facilities where weapons are built, according to CNN.  The Trump administration has since tried to reverse their terminations, according to media outlets, but has reportedly struggled to reach the people that were fired after they were locked out of their federal email accounts. A memo sent to NNSA employees on Friday and obtained by NBC News read: ""The termination letters for some NNSA probationary employees are being rescinded, but we do not have a good way to get in touch with those personnel."" ""Please work with your supervisors to send this information (once you get it) to people's personal contact emails,"" the memo added. Last week, nearly 10,000 federal workers were let go across several agencies, according to multiple US outlets.  That figure was in addition to the estimated 75,000 workers who have accepted an offer from the White House to leave voluntarily in the autumn.  Trump is working to slash spending across the board, abroad and at home, and going so far as to call for eliminating the education department.  He is getting help from the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who, through an effort called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), has sent workers to comb through data at federal agencies and helped implement the ""buyout"" offer. Last week, the Trump administration ordered agencies to fire nearly all probationary employees, those who had generally been in their positions for less than a year and not yet earned job protection. That included the NNSA staff members. Altogether, the move could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of people.  Several of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the government's size and spending have been met with legal challenges.  More than 60 lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration since the president was inaugurated on 20 January. US-Israeli talks follow President Trump's proposal - widely condemned internationally - to take over Gaza and move the Palestinians out. The Munich conference exposed tensions between the US and Europe over Nato and Ukraine - the BBC's Frank Gardner explains why this was a watershed in relations. A Ukrainian government source told the BBC Kyiv would not be present at the proposed peace talks. Kentucky has seen the worst effects of the rain thus far, reporting at least eight dead.

"South Korean actress Kim Sae-ron, 24, found dead",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c626p25egddo,"South Korean actress Kim Sae-ron has been found dead in Seoul, police have said. The 24-year-old was found in her home in the city's Seongsu-dong district by a friend at around 16:55 (07:55 GMT) on Sunday. Officers said no signs of foul play had been found and they were investigating the cause of death. Kim began her career as a child actor and was seen as one of South Korea's most promising young actresses. Born in Seoul in 2000, she rose to prominence with her role in 2009 film A Brand New Life - which saw her appear at the Cannes Film Festival. She went on to star in South Korea's highest grossing film of 2010 The Man from Nowhere and 2012 thriller The Neighbour, for which she received award recognition. Other notable roles include the 2014 film A Girl at My Door and television roles such as Mirror of the Witch in 2016. The actress largely withdrew from the public eye in 2022 due to a drink driving incident, for which she was fined 20 million won (£11,000) in April 2023. Kim's last role was in Netflix's 2023 Korean drama Bloodhounds. Variety reported that most of her role was edited out due to the driving incident. Eyewitnesses and relatives of victims spoke of their pain and trauma after a crush at an overcrowded railway station claimed 18 lives. Hwang Ui-jo, who played for Nottingham Forest, was found guilty of illegally filming sexual encounters.  Police arrested her for ""criminal damage"" as the bun did not regain its shape and could not be sold.

"US isolation threatens global democracy, warns Major",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwngxdd1vo,"Sir John Major has warned that democracy is under threat as the United States steps back from its leading role in the world. The former prime minister told the BBC that US President Donald Trump's policy of American ""isolation"" was creating a power vacuum that would embolden nations like Russia and China. Sir John, who was PM from 1990 to 1997, said the gains made since the collapse of the Soviet Union were now being reversed - and that there was ""no doubt"" Russia would invade elsewhere before long. He said that ""ugly nationalism"" growing concurrently was making for a ""very unsettled time"". His comments come as European leaders prepare for an emergency summit on Monday on the war in Ukraine.  US and Russian officials are due to open peace talks in the coming days despite concerns European nations including Ukraine were being locked out. Sir John also rejected US Vice-President JD Vance's recent criticism of Europe's record on free speech, suggesting the remarks should have been directed at the authorities in Moscow or Beijing. He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It's extremely odd to lecture Europe on the subject of free speech and democracy at the same time as they're cuddling [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.  ""In Mr Putin's Russia, people who disagree with him disappear, or die, or flee the country, or - on a statistically unlikely level - fall out of high windows somewhere in Moscow.""  Sir John said the world was changing and ""may not be reshaping in a way that is congenial to the West"".   He continued: ""Many of the gains we made over recent years, when the Soviet Union collapsed, are now being reversed and you see a very aggressive Russia again in Ukraine.  ""And if they were to succeed with their venture in Ukraine, no doubt they'd be elsewhere before too long. ""There is no doubt in my mind that democracy has been in modest decline over the last 18 years.  ""There is an ugly nationalism growing, mostly from the intolerant right… So it is a very unsettled time."" The former Conservative leader, who presided over a tumultuous time for the UK's economy, said he sympathised with the challenges the current Chancellor Rachel Reeves faced, but said the global situation may require more defence funding. ""It's very, very easy to say from outside government, 'I'd just do this and I'd spend all this money'.  ""I would prefer to say I would realise in my plans that we have to make a very material increase in the level of defence expenditure and do it as a priority as soon as it is credible to do so."" Speaking earlier on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK and Europe had to respond to US demands for them to pay more towards their ""collective defence"" in the face of ""greater threats"". He said the government would set out a roadmap to increase defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of the nation's economic output, but declined to offer a definitive timetable. Reynolds also played down divisions between the US and its allies over resolving the Ukraine conflict, insisting there was ""still a great deal of common ground"". Sir John has made public interventions on a number of issues in recent years, including Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which started in 2022. Shortly after the war began, he and another former prime minister, Gordon Brown, were among signatories of a petition calling for Putin to face a Nuremberg-style trial for war crimes over his actions in Ukraine. The president opened the Nascar season with a flyby and lap in front of the racing cars. It is having problems contacting people who were fired in Trump's blitz to shrink the federal workforce. It comes as Donald Trump's envoy says Europe will not be involved in peace talks to end the war.

Netanyahu praises Trump's 'bold vision' for Gaza at Rubio meeting,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9eddnnq4go,"Israel's prime minister has said he is working to make US President Donald Trump's plan to remove and resettle Gaza's population ""a reality"". Benjamin Netanyahu said he was co-operating with the US on a ""common strategy"" for the Palestinian territory after a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem on Sunday. The talks come after US President Donald Trump proposed a US takeover Gaza and removal of the two million Palestinians there to neighbouring countries.  The UN has warned that any forced displacement of civilians from occupied territory is strictly prohibited under international law and ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"". America's top diplomat said President Trump's plan may have ""shocked and surprised"" people, but it took ""courage"" to propose an alternative to ""tired ideas"" of the past. Netanyahu said he and Rubio had discussed ways to implement Trump's vision, adding that the US and Israel had a common position on Gaza. The Israeli leader warned that the ""gates of hell"" would be opened if all Israeli hostages held by the armed group Hamas were not released. ""Hamas can not continue as a military or government force,"" Rubio added. ""And as long as it stands as a force that can govern or administer or a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible."" The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. The fighting has caused devastation in Gaza, where more than 48,200 people have been killed during the 16-month war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter. Palestinian and Arab leaders have widely rejected Trump's Gaza takeover plan, with the Palestinian Authority and Hamas emphasising that Palestinian land is ""not for sale"". Unlike previous US peace efforts in the region, the US top diplomat did not meet any Palestinian leaders to discuss the future of Gaza. Speaking at a joint news conference on Sunday, Rubio and Netanyahu outlined areas of agreement, including a desire to eradicate Hamas's governing capacity in the enclave, prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon, and to monitor developments in post-Assad Syria. Rubio went on to accuse Tehran of being ""behind every act of violence, behind every destabilising activity, behind everything that threatens peace and stability"" in the region. Netanyahu also condemned what he called ""lawfare"" from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which he said ""outrageously libelled"" Israel. He thanked the US administration for issuing sanctions against the ICC, which last year issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former defence minister over alleged war crimes in Gaza - which Israel denies - as well as a top Hamas commander. Rubio is visiting Israel on his first tour of the Middle East as the US secretary of state. He is also due to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in coming days for talks on the war in Ukraine - a meeting that neither Ukraine nor other European countries have been invited to. His visit comes after a shipment of American-made heavy bombs arrived in Israel overnight. Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said his country had received a delivery of MK-84 bombs from the US late on Saturday, after Trump overturned a block on exporting the munitions placed by his predecessor, Joe Biden. Biden initially shipped thousands of MK-84s to Israel after Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, but later declined to clear the bombs for export out of concern for their impact on Gaza. The powerful 2,000-pound bombs have a wide blast radius and can rip through concrete and metal, destroying entire buildings. Katz said the shipment represented a ""significant asset"" for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and served as evidence of the ""strong alliance between Israel and the United States"". Meanwhile, Hamas said an Israeli air strike had killed three police officers near Rafah in southern Gaza on Sunday, which it called a ""serious violation"" of the ceasefire. Israel said it had struck ""several armed individuals"" in southern Gaza. The ceasefire came into force on 19 January and requires a complete pause in fighting for the first 42-day phase.  Fears had been high this week that the fragile ceasefire agreement could collapse after a dispute over a planned hostage release, which was nearly aborted but ultimately went ahead on Saturday. Netanyahu's office confirmed on Sunday that an Israeli negotiating team would travel to Cairo on Monday to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire. The Munich conference exposed tensions between the US and Europe over Nato and Ukraine - the BBC's Frank Gardner explains why this was a watershed in relations. A Ukrainian government source told the BBC Kyiv would not be present at the proposed peace talks. Kentucky has seen the worst effects of the rain thus far, reporting at least eight dead.

"From the Gulf of America to Fort Bragg, what's behind Trump's name changes?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwypzzey425o,"​​President Donald Trump has always understood the power of branding. As a celebrity businessman, he affixed his name to the facades of his skyscrapers and licensed his name to an array of products, from hotels to wines. Now, he is attempting his boldest branding campaign yet: America itself. On his first day back in office, he signed an order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. Denali, the indigenous name for the famed Alaskan peak, will revert back to Mount McKinley, a reference to the assassinated 19th century president.  Fort Bragg, which was named for a Confederate general until the military changed it to Fort Liberty, will again bear its original name – but this time attributed to a far less controversial soldier from World War Two. Trump is not the first US president to rename a monument. It was Barack Obama, a Democrat, who renamed Mount McKinley to its Native American name, Denali, after years of lobbying from Alaskans.  George W Bush, a Republican, renamed the Caribbean National Forest in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to the El Yunque National Forest in 2007, to reflect the US territory's heritage. And after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 sparked a national reckoning on race, Congress initiated a process to rename US military bases named after Confederate figures. In 2023, during Joe Biden's presidency, the Department of Defense renamed nine US military bases, including Fort Bragg. At the heart of these decisions is a desire to portray America, and its values, in a particular light. ""The act of naming is a way that presidents can reshape their vision of the nation,"" said Allison Prasch, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies political rhetoric. Trump's choices in his second term send a clear message about his priorities too, she said. ""It is elevating a very nationalist, imperialist vision of the United States,"" Ms Prasch said. Some of Trump's name choices are callbacks to America's expansionist age, when the prevailing ideology said that America had a God-given mission to expand from shore to shore.  Part of President William McKinley's legacy was his role in annexing Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines and Hawaii. In changing Denali's name, Trump said he wanted to honour McKinley because he ""made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent"". It's an ideology that seems to inform Trump today too, as he has also floated the idea of retaking the Panama Canal, which had once been under US control, buying Greenland and annexing Canada to become the ""51st state"". Meanwhile, renaming Fort Bragg is the latest in an ongoing debate over the legacy of the Confederacy – the coalition of southern states that seceded from the US over the issue of slavery and triggered the Civil War. During Trump's first administration, amid a national reckoning over racial injustice, Congress required the Pentagon to rename facilities named after Confederates and banned future military installations from being named after them. The move rankled Trump then, who tried to veto the measure and declared that ""our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with!"" Congress overrode him with bipartisan support. But historian Connor Williams, who served on the renaming committee that had recommended the name Bragg be removed in 2021, said that honouring the Confederacy is misguided.  ""What makes Confederates such bad topics for commemoration is that they have very little to redeem them,"" Williams said. ""They committed treason against the United States."" ""What we commemorate, what we celebrate, what public displays we make, where we place wreathes – the president does have that ability to signal what he thinks is important,"" he added. In 2023, the Biden administration changed Fort Bragg, named after Confederate general Braxton Bragg, to Fort Liberty. ""We seized this opportunity to make ourselves better and to seek excellence,"" Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue said at the renaming ceremony. ""That is what we always have done and always will do."" However, the name change prompted mixed feelings among lawmakers, former military personnel who spent time there, and the local community. ""I understand the reasoning behind the change, and I have to accept it because it's what the elected leadership has determined is in the best interest,"" Cumberland County Commissioner Jimmy Keefe said at the time according to local media. ""But I hate that so many people who have had positive experiences at Fort Bragg, who have had children born there, weddings there, that they will no longer have that tether of Fort Bragg in the name."" This week, Trump's new Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, restored the base's name to Fort Bragg.  But this time, he said the base will be named after Private First Class Roland Bragg, who fought in World War II, rather than a Confederate general. ""That's right,"" Hegseth said. ""Bragg is back."" Republican lawmakers representing the base expressed enthusiasm about the change. ""Renaming Fort Bragg for Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, who earned the Silver Star and Purple Heart in WWII, was always the right decision,"" North Carolina Senator Ted Budd wrote on Facebook. But nationally, many of Trump's name changes have proved controversial. A Marquette University poll suggested that 71% of US adults did not support changing the Gulf of Mexico's name, and just 29% supported it. Some of the changes have sparked debates about whose vision of American history should officially stand. A poll by Alaska Survey Research suggested 47% of Alaska's Trump's voters favoured the name change. But overall, Alaskans opposed the name change by a two-to-one margin, the Juneau Express reported. Democrats and Republicans in Alaska's legislature banded together to pass a resolution urging Trump not to change Denali's name. ""To officially change the name would not only dishonor those who have fought to protect Denali's legacy but also dismiss the voices of the Native communities whose roots are intertwined with this land,"" said Alaska Representative Maxine Dibert, a Democrat and a member of the indigenous Koyukon Athabascan community. Time will tell whether Trump's symbolic name changes endure. But the arguments about them shows no signs of abating. This week, the White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from the Oval Office this week because the wire service kept Gulf of Mexico in its popular style guide. AP executive editor Julie Pace called the decision ""alarming"" and said it violated the constitution's free speech rights. Meanwhile, Google - which now uses the name Gulf of America on its maps for US users - has begun deleting negative reviews of the name change. Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America might be a land (or water) grab on paper only, but its symbolism is undeniable, said Ms Prasch, the professor of political rhetoric at the University of Wisconsin. And it goes beyond geography to strike a chord about how the country views itself - and its history. ""I actually think that this is much more than renaming a body of water on a map,""  she said. ""It is a fundamentally rhetorical decision about how we think about the story of the nation."" Danielle Sassoon resigned after Trump's justice department ordered her to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. The US president ordered his staff to develop a response to countries with trade policies he says are unfair.  A conservative think tank set out a sweeping vision for governing that could influence Trump's next term. What influence has it had so far?

What it means when Elon Musk brings his children to work,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgerr2jvkgo,"Elon Musk's children have been to places many will never see. From meetings with foreign leaders to the control room of a SpaceX launch, Musk's children have debuted as constant sidekicks to their father's endeavors in tech, business and now, politics. They have made frequent appearances in the nation's capital since President Donald Trump tapped the tech billionaire and Tesla CEO to lead the newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency. Musk's four-year-old, ""Lil X"", hung on the corner of the Resolute desk in the Oval Office on Wednesday sporting a tan pea coat and a collared shirt. On Thursday, X and two of his siblings exchanged gifts with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while their father discussed technology and innovation with the foreign leader. Musk has frequently been seen with his children even before coming to Washington - at a meeting with the president of Turkey, a memorial service at Auschwitz concentration camp, and a Time magazine ceremony where he was named the 2021 person of the year. But why do Musk's children tag along? ""The inclusion of the kids in many public appearances is very much a politician move or a political move to make him seem a bit more personable (and) take a human approach to how the public views him,"" says Kurt Braddock, an American University professor of public communication. Still, Mr Braddock thought the decision to bring Musk's preschooler to the Oval Office was unusual. X appeared bored during the 30-minute press briefing as he mimicked his father, sat on the floor and received the occasional side glance and smile from the leader of the free world. At one point, it appeared he told someone in the room to ""shush"" their mouth. Mr Braddock said he believes their inclusion is intentional - a distraction that benefits both Musk and Trump. ""I do think that there is a bit of a strategy here trying to draw attention to some things while diverting attention to other things,"" he said. Jon Haber, a strategic communication consultant who has worked with five presidential campaigns and teaches at Harvard, said Musk's children making frequent appearances - and creating viral moments - is beneficial for Trump. ""For Trump, the more chaos, the more he floods the zone, the less anybody can really focus on. Chaos works for him,"" Mr Haber said. Grimes, Musk's ex-girlfriend and the mother of X, criticised her son's appearance in the Oval Office. ""He should not be in public like this,"" she wrote in a post on X. ""I did not see this… but I'm glad he was polite. Sigh."" In a 2022 Vanity Fair article, she said that she wasn't a fan of her son being in the spotlight. ""Whatever is going on with family stuff, I just feel like kids need to stay out of it, and X is just out there. I mean, I think E is really seeing him as a protégé and bringing him to everything and stuff.… X is out there. His situation is like that. But, yeah, I don't know."" Long before politics, Musk allowed his children to tag along.  A decade ago, when he was still building his profile and eager to draw attention to his electric-vehicle maker Tesla, it wasn't unusual to see them at events. As analysts and reporters waited for one unveiling to begin at a Tesla facility in Silicon Valley in 2015, his five children could be seen running through the hallways chasing after each other and shrieking with laughter. Despite being forced to wait for hours for attendees, the presence of Musk's children created an atmosphere that felt relaxed and even joyous. It was a departure from the stiff, far more formal events held by other companies for which the prospect of seeing an executive's very young children would have come across as odd. Musk has had 12 children with three different women. His most-recognised son, X Æ A-12?, goes by ""Lil X"", the same letter Musk used to re-name Twitter when he purchased the social media company. The four-year-old has been dubbed an ""emotional support human"" by Musk himself. Walter Isaacson, the author of Musk's biography, said on The Diary of a CEO podcast that Musk is ""deeply committed"" to his children and is ""almost obsessed by them"". ""With his own children, his lovers, his wives, there is the same intensity that is baked into everything he does,"" Mr Isaacson said. ""He always likes having some of his children around him. He always likes having a companion, but that doesn't mean that he likes calmness."" US-Israeli talks follow President Trump's proposal - widely condemned internationally - to take over Gaza and move the Palestinians out. The Munich conference exposed tensions between the US and Europe over Nato and Ukraine - the BBC's Frank Gardner explains why this was a watershed in relations. A Ukrainian government source told the BBC Kyiv would not be present at the proposed peace talks. Kentucky has seen the worst effects of the rain thus far, reporting at least eight dead.
